VODER brings together **8 processing modes** under one interface — speech-to-text, text-to-speech, voice conversion, music generation, speech enhancement, sound effects, vocal separation, and speaker diarization — plus language dubbing (`tts dub`), any-to-any translation via TranslateGemma 12B, transcribe-edit-resynthesize (built into TTS interactive), three task-layer features that build on top of the modes: **`train`** (save reusable voice clones as `.tts` / `.ttse`), **side-quests** (`quest` — lightweight utility tasks like URL download and audio manipulation), and **chains** (user-defined pipelines that wire any number of voder oneline tasks together end-to-end). It runs entirely on your machine, needs no subscription, and works with or without a GPU.

With **Project Eva** (the DLC expansion), VODER also does **text-to-image** (TTI), **text-to-video** (TTV), **text-to-world** (TTW — 3D scene generation), and **text-to-text chat** (TTT — VADAR, the uncensored local AI). Eva is a DLC — it plugs into VODER's existing engine, same infrastructure, same CLI patterns. Access it via `python voder.py eva <mode>`.

## Features

- **Multi-Speaker Dialogue System** — Write scripts with multiple characters, each with a distinct voice. Control per-line timing, volume, and duration with script directives. Embed sound effects directly into dialogue lines and generate automatic background music that matches the spoken duration.
- **Voice Design & Cloning** — Describe a voice in plain English and VODER generates it, or provide a reference clip to clone a speaker's voice. Mix designed and cloned voices within the same dialogue.
- **Speaker Separation** — Extract individual speakers from multi-speaker recordings into separate audio files, each with a speaker-labeled transcript.
- **Voice Conversion with Video I/O** — Transform one voice into another while preserving words, emotion, and timing. Drop in an MP4 and get back a video with the converted voice.
- **Music Generation & Manipulation** — Generate full songs from lyrics and style descriptions. Remix, repaint, complete, extract stems, build individual instrument tracks, or replace background music in existing audio/video. Output up to 12 separate instrument tracks.
- **Speech-to-Text with Intelligence** — Transcribe audio, video, images, or direct URLs. Translate to any of 76 languages via TranslateGemma. Identify who spoke when with speaker diarization. Batch process multiple files.
- **Language Dubbing** — Translate speech from one language to another while preserving the original speaker's voice identity. Dub entire videos with per-segment timing alignment and background music preservation.
- **Any-to-Any Translation** — Translate between any of 76 languages using TranslateGemma 12B via the `translate (source-target)` syntax, decoupled from the ASR engine.
- **Voice Re-Synthesis** — Transcribe speech and re-read it in a different voice using `tts svc`, with an optional `sts:` prefix for high-fidelity voice conversion via Seed-VC v2.
- **Side-Quests** — Lightweight utility tasks that live outside the main engine: URL download, audio format conversion, cutting / merging / mixing / removing ranges, silence stripping, speed / pitch / soundlevel / bassboost / reverb / loudnorm effects, and more. Run `python voder.py quest` to see all available quests, grouped by category.
- **Chains** — User-defined pipelines that wire any number of voder tasks together: each chain is named, its output is captured to temp, and later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths. Build a song, isolate its vocals, train a voice from them, then dub a video — all in one command.
- **Smart Input Pipeline** — Paste a YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter URL directly as input. VODER verifies the link actually points to a video before downloading. Feed an image and VODER extracts text via OCR. Automatically extract voice clips from multi-speaker audio for one-click voice cloning.
- **Project Eva DLC** — Image generation/editing (Flux 2 Dev), video generation with audio (MiniMax H3), video editing (Wan 2.1 VACE), 3D world generation (HY-World 2.0), image-to-3D object conversion (TRELLIS.2), and VADAR — the uncensored local AI chatbot (Gemma 4 12B via Ollama). All accessible via `voder.py eva <tti|ttv|ttt|ttw>`.

## What Can VODER Do?

### Text-to-Speech with Voice Design & Cloning

Describe a voice in plain English — *"deep male voice, authoritative"* — and VODER generates speech that matches. Or provide a reference audio clip and VODER **clones the speaker's voice** from it. Both approaches can be **mixed in the same dialogue**: some characters designed, others cloned.

### Multi-Speaker Dialogue System

Write scripts with multiple characters, each with a distinct voice. VODER assembles the full dialogue into a single audio file with per-line control over timing, volume, and duration via **script directives** (`/time`, `/level`, `/duration`). Embed **sound effects** directly into dialogue lines using the special `sfx:` character — door creaks, applause, rain — generated on the fly from text descriptions.

### Automatic Background Music

When generating dialogue, VODER can produce a background music track that **exactly matches the spoken duration**, mixed at a configurable volume with fade transitions. An optional **reference** (audio, video, or URL) can be provided for stylistic guidance — the reference is processed through SVS to extract clean instrumental before use. No manual editing or external tools needed.

### Voice Conversion (Speech & Music)

Transform one voice into another while preserving the original words, emotion, and timing. Supports **video input/output** — drop in an MP4 and get back a video with the converted voice. For music, VODER switches to a high-fidelity 44.1kHz model. A **mimic** mode transfers not just the voice timbre but the accent and speaking style as well.

### Music Generation & Manipulation

Generate full songs from lyrics and style descriptions. Beyond basic generation, VODER supports **6 sub-tasks**: remix (style transfer with bias control), repaint (restyle a specific time range), complete (add missing instruments), lego (build individual tracks), extract (isolate specific stems), and bgm (replace background music in existing audio/video with generated music at a configurable volume). Output up to **12 individual instrument tracks** for post-production. A three-tier quality system lets you trade speed for output quality.

### Vocal & Music Separation

Isolate clean vocals from any song, or extract the instrumental. Works with audio files, videos, and direct URLs from any supported platform (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter). This separation engine also runs automatically behind the scenes in TTS (to clean voice cloning references), STS (to improve conversion quality), and STT (to pre-clean audio before transcription).

### Speech-to-Text with Speaker Intelligence

Transcribe audio, video, images, or direct URLs to text. Supports **translation to English** from 99 languages, **speaker diarization** (who spoke when), and **batch processing** of multiple files. An **overdose mode** using Microsoft VibeVoice ASR delivers higher-quality transcription with built-in speaker identification.

### Sound Enhancement

Remove noise, reduce room echo, and restore clarity from degraded recordings. Upscale audio to 48kHz with AudioSR super-resolution (basic model for general audio, speech model for voice). Works on audio and video files alike.

### Speaker Separation

Extract individual speakers from multi-speaker recordings into separate audio files, each with a speaker-labeled transcript. The `blend` flag preserves non-vocals (background audio) in each speaker's output, and the `video` flag muxes separated audio with the original video for MP4 output — useful for removing unwanted speakers from a video while keeping the visuals.

### Language Conversion (TTS Sub-Task)

Translate speech from any language to English while **preserving the original speaker's voice identity** — `tts slc "audio.wav"`. Supports any-to-any translation via TranslateGemma with the `translate (source-target)` syntax. An optional `music` flag preserves the original instrumental track, and `overdose` adds a voice fidelity pass. Accepts audio files, videos, and supported platform URLs.

### Video/Audio Dubbing (TTS Sub-Task)

Dub entire videos to another language with **per-segment timing alignment** — `tts dub "video.mp4"` auto-translates to English by default. Uses VibeVoice ASR with audio events, TranslateGemma per-segment translation, Fish S2 Pro voice cloning, speed adjustment, and timeline assembly. Add `subtitle` to burn translated subtitles. Add `translate "(auto-ja)"` to target any language. Preserves background music.

### Smart Input Pipeline

Paste a URL from **YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter** directly as input — VODER auto-detects the platform, verifies the link points to a real video (not a channel page, profile, photo post, or playlist), then downloads and processes it. Feed an **image** containing text and VODER extracts it via OCR for TTS processing. Automatic voice clip extraction from multi-speaker audio enables one-click voice cloning for dialogue characters.

### Side-Quests (`quest`)

Lightweight utility tasks that live outside the voder engine but are still useful in a voice-processing workflow — URL download, audio format conversion, cutting, merging, **mixing** (overlay multiple sources at specified start times), range removal, silence stripping, soundlevel / speed / pitch / bassboost / reverb / loudnorm, and more. Side-quests are grouped by category in the listing — `download` stands alone, the rest live under **Media Manipulation**. Run `python voder.py quest` (no args) to list every available side-quest with its one-line description. See [COMMAND_CATALOG.md](docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md) for the full list.

### Chains (`chains`)

User-defined pipelines that wire any number of voder oneline tasks together. Each chain is named, runs a full voder oneline command, and its output is captured to a temp directory. Later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths — VODER resolves them internally to the captured temp file. Side-quests work inside chains just like any other oneline task.

```
# TTM → SVS → STS pipeline
python src/voder.py chains "song" ttm lyrics "la la la" styling "pop" 30 / "voice" svs voice "song" / "cover" sts base "voice" target "ref.wav"
```

Use ` / ` (space slash space) to separate chains. Intermediate chain outputs live in `temp_chains/`; only the **last** non-empty chain's output reaches `results/`. Empty chains are skipped (their names remain available for reuse); duplicate names cause an error and stop the pipeline. This lets you compose pipelines that VODER's built-in modes never anticipated — generate music, isolate vocals, train a voice from them, then dub a video, all in a single command.

## Project El Final

I worked on this for more than six months. I kept adding things and expanding stuff. First, it was an idea about an absolutely different thing, but I liked this version of the idea. I felt depressed first because it felt empty and basic. I kept building on it until it became the thing it is. Then I felt it was still missing some stuff that I would like to add — like chatting, or media generation. I figured out a way to do that, and I did. But now I can peacefully say this project reached a point that there is nothing more to put in it or develop more stuff.

Tech will get more advanced and models will become better and better every few months. An end-of-life does not mean it will not receive more updates — but they will just be maintenance, like replacing models or some basic stuff from time to time, and it will just not be the bleeding VODER it used to be. I will fix issues if someone reports some. The project will likely be in a RIP situation where I can finally work on other real projects without feeling that itchy-scratchy feeling that I missed something or forgot to fix a bug in VODER again.

The full story is in [Guide.md → Project El Final](docs/Guide.md#project-el-final).

*Y así, sin más... el fin.*
