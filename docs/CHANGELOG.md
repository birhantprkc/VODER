# CHANGELOG

- All notable changes to VODER will be documented in this file.
- This project does not use version names like v1.2.3; it just timestamps changes. It will always be updated every time I notice something wrong.
- If you are really interested on what happens in this project, tracing the commit history would be better because I forget to document every change (or if you are mad enough, just read voder.py).

## 10/01/2026
- Status: In development — Project Eva DLC (v6 polishing)
- **Eva TTI overdose — Qwen-Image-2.1 Uncensored for uncensored image generation and editing, with native transparent nbg generation AND editing**
- **Eva TTW explorify — NVIDIA Lyra 2.0: image to explorable 3D world scene**

### TTI Overdose — Qwen-Image-2.1 UC

Added a third TTI sub-mode family: `overdose gen` and `overdose edit`, running [Qwen-Image-2.1 Uncensored](https://huggingface.co/0xSojalSec/Qwen-Image-2.1-Uncensored-HF) — GGUF quantizations of [Qwen/Qwen-Image-2.1](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-2.1), the original upstream base weights with safety checks disabled. Because it is the same exact base model with only the safety checks removed, quality is identical to the censored model — nothing is lost anywhere. This is the second uncensored model in VODER next to the VADAR chat model.

**The overdose naming nuance:** in core VODER, `overdose` refers to high-resource, over-the-top model variants. TTI overdose is the opposite trade — it runs on **16GB VRAM + 16GB RAM** (less than the main Flux 2 Dev, which wants 24GB+ and ~64GB of weights) while producing sharper, more detailed results. Same name, inverted economics.

**Inference settings (locked for best quality per official model docs):** 40 steps, guidance 1.0, euler sampler with simple scheduler, denoise 1.0 — taken from the official Qwen-Image-2.1 model card and the official Comfy-Org workflow templates (the ComfyUI template ships 25 steps as a faster preset). Qwen-Image-2.1 needs no negative-prompt CFG pass; negative guidance is not part of the model's tuned recipe.

**Architecture:** The model runs through **ComfyUI** with the **ComfyUI-GGUF** custom node (leejet fork, native Qwen-Image 2.1 support) inside its own isolated venv — a new integration pattern for Eva (diffusers-native, Ollama subprocess, custom pipeline, and now ComfyUI backend). The runner clones ComfyUI into `src/models/checkpoints/qwen_image_2_1_uc/ComfyUI/` if missing, clones the GGUF node into `custom_nodes/`, auto-downloads the weights on first use, launches the ComfyUI server on a free local port (`--lowvram`, or `--cpu` on CPU-only machines), submits the workflow over the local API, follows the whole run live over ComfyUI's websocket progress stream and copies the output PNG to the result path. The server is terminated after every run — same load, run, unload discipline as every other VODER model.

**Weights (auto-downloaded into the ComfyUI model folders):**

| File | Role | Size |
|------|------|------|
| `qwen-image-2.1-UC-Q4_K_M.gguf` | Transformer (GGUF, recommended quant) | ~4.6GB |
| `text_encoders/qwen3vl_8b_int8_convrot.safetensors` | Text encoder (qwen3vl 8B int8) | ~9.35GB |
| `vae/qwen_image_2.1_vae_bf16.safetensors` | VAE | ~676MB |

**Command syntax:**
```
voder.py eva tti overdose gen desc "a mythical dragon perched atop a snowy mountain peak" [resolution "1024x1024"] [seed 0] [reference "ref.png"]
voder.py eva tti overdose edit "input.png" desc "change the outfit color" [reference "ref.png"] [resolution "1024x1024"] [seed 0]
voder.py eva tti overdose nbg desc "a cartoon dragon sticker" [resolution "1024x1024"] [seed 0]
voder.py eva tti overdose edit nbg "input.png" desc "remove the background, keep the character" [resolution "1024x1024"] [seed 0]
voder.py eva tti overdose gen nbg desc "a cartoon dragon sticker" (explicit long form of overdose nbg)
```

**References:** up to 3 image references per call, local paths or URLs — URLs are resolved through VODER's universal URL downloader (the same unified internal net layer every other mode uses, no duplications). References are seen by the qwen3vl text encoder and spliced into the sequence as VAE reference latents through the official `TextEncodeQwenImage21` node. Generation defaults to `1024x1024` with the full Qwen native 2K aspect-ratio set supported up to a 2752px max dimension (unsupported values warn and fall back, same as every other Eva model). Editing follows the official Qwen-Image-2.1 edit workflow: instruction-based whole-image editing where the output keeps the input image's aspect ratio at the requested pixel area — no SAM masking, this is not an inpainting model.

**Native transparency (`overdose nbg`, `overdose edit nbg`):** Qwen-Image-2.1 generates RGBA natively — its VAE decodes the 64-channel latent straight to RGB+alpha, so `nbg` here does NOT use the Flux 2 green-screen trick or any SAM cutout. `voder.py eva tti overdose nbg desc "..."` wraps the description in the official RGBA prompt format from the model card ("This is an RGBA image with transparency. ... The image has alpha channel and the background is transparent.") and saves the decoded alpha directly as a transparent PNG — if the model still returns a fully opaque frame the run prints a warning instead of pretending it worked. `overdose gen nbg` is the explicit long form of the same thing. The same native RGBA recipe also covers editing: `overdose edit nbg` edits an existing image and returns a transparent PNG — transparent inputs are preserved end-to-end (alpha survives the whole chain, input downscale included, the vision tower sees alpha-over-white while the VAE keeps all four channels), and an opaque input still works with a warning: the edit runs on it and only the output carries transparency. The nbg modes take no references, same contract as the other nbg modes.

**Progress in the CLI:** the runner subscribes to ComfyUI's websocket progress stream with a per-run client id and renders the sampler step counts as a tqdm-style bar (`Sampling: 12/40 [01:23<02:45, 3.50s/it]`) plus stage notes for transformer/text-encoder/VAE loading, prompt encoding and decoding — the same steps visibility the other Eva modes get from their diffusers progress bars. If the stream cannot be opened the run falls back to history polling and says so.

**Resources:** 16GB VRAM + 16GB RAM (CUDA), or CPU-only with 32GB RAM (generation is slow but works — ComfyUI runs with `--cpu`). Tested reference point: a T4 (16GB) at ~12GB RAM / ~14GB VRAM with the lowvram flag.

**Interactive CLI:** TTI menu option `4. Overdose (uncensored generation — Qwen-Image-2.1 UC)` asks for the generation type first — standard generation with optional references, or `NBG` transparent PNG (no references, same contract as the other nbg modes). Editing stays out of the interactive CLI; overdose editing is available in one-line mode.

**All existing Eva infrastructure applies:** the `result` keyword, `&&` extended commands with the Dimensions Resolver, chains integration, and output naming `voder_eva_tti_overdose_<gen|edit|nbg>_<description>_<timestamp>.png`.

**Files:**
- New: `src/envs/qwen-image2.1-uc/` — isolated venv folder (torch, gguf, transformers, accelerate, websocket-client, ComfyUI dependency base)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/image/qwen.py` — `QwenImageUCWrapper` (overdose gen/edit/nbg, reference and URL resolution through the shared media layer)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_runners/qwen-image2.1-uc_runner.py` — ComfyUI backend runner (clone/custom-node/weights self-healing, server lifecycle on a free port, official t2i, edit and native-RGBA nbg workflows, websocket step progress, result polling and copy)
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — `overdose` added to `EVA_SUB_MODES`, `eva tti overdose <gen|edit|nbg>` parsing, `overdose_gen`/`overdose_edit`/`overdose_nbg` routing in `_eva_tti` with the platform-URL gate, keyword lists updated. No in-code comments.
- Modified: `src/voders/interactiveCLI/__init__.py` — TTI interactive menu option 4 (overdose generation type choice: standard with references or NBG transparent PNG)
- Modified: `setup.py` — `qwen-image2.1-uc` registered in `EVA_ENVS` with a ComfyUI post-install step (clones ComfyUI + ComfyUI-GGUF, installs their requirements into the venv)
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_paths.py` — `QWEN_IMAGE_UC_DIR` / `QWEN_IMAGE_UC_COMFYUI_DIR` checkpoint paths
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_envrunner.py` — `qwen-image2.1-uc` registered in `EVA_RUNNERS`
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/downscale.py` — image downscale now keeps the alpha channel (IMREAD_UNCHANGED) so oversized transparent inputs survive into overdose edit, with a PIL fallback when cv2 cannot write the target format
- Modified: `README.md` — Eva feature bullet, modes-at-a-glance row, models table, system requirements note, overdose examples
- Modified: `docs/Guide.md` — Eva requirements table row, VRAM summary, env directory tree and rationale
- Modified: `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md` — Eva modes table, full overdose subsection under TTI (keywords, resolutions, locked inference settings, native-transparency nbg, editing model, examples)
- Modified: `docs/READ.md` — git dependency note, Qwen-Image-2.1 UC model directory row
- Modified: `docs/Languages.md` — Qwen-Image-2.1 UC row (80+ languages via the qwen3vl 8B text encoder)

### TTW Explorify — NVIDIA Lyra 2.0

Added a fourth TTW sub-mode: `explorify`, running [NVIDIA Lyra 2.0](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Lyra-2.0) — NVIDIA's explorable generative 3D world model. It is a different kind of world model than `ttw gen` (HY-World 2.0 builds a closed 3D environment from text; Lyra 2.0 takes an input image first, sticks closely to it, and extends the scene like you really moved through the area). It generates a camera-controlled exploration video from the image internally, then lifts that video into a persistent 3D Gaussian Splatting scene — the final output is a scene file that can be imported into Blender, Unity, Unreal, Godot, and anything else that reads 3DGS PLY.

**Everything runs headless.** There is no GUI dependency — the camera movement is programmatic, driven by the official preset trajectory system (27 trajectory names — `horizontal_zoom`, `orbit_horizontal`, `dolly_zoom`, `spiral`, … — with built-in collision detection), exposed through the `trajectory`, `direction`, and `strength` keywords, and the official `duration`/frame-count rules are respected (frames must be `1 + 80k` per direction, minimum 81 — `duration` seconds at 16 fps are snapped to the nearest valid counts, split ~25/75 into zoom-in/zoom-out, and the run prints exactly what it snapped to).

**The two-model chain — text to explorable world:** Lyra 2.0 requires an image, not text. When only `desc` is given, VODER first generates the seed image with TTI overdose (Qwen-Image-2.1 UC) using pre-set good settings (`1280x720` — the closest supported aspect to the official 832x480 Lyra canvas — and the shared `seed`), then feeds that image to explorify. When both an input file and `desc` are given, the image is used directly and `desc` becomes the scene caption the video model conditions on (the official flow pairs every image with a caption; a missing caption falls back to a generic one instead of failing).

**Architecture:** the official two-step inference pipeline runs verbatim (vendored under `src/lyra2/`, upstream Apache 2.0 code, inference path only — no GUI, no training assets, no notebooks), each step as its own process with full load/run/unload separation: step 1 is the official `lyra2_zoomgs_inference` autoregressive generator (Depth Anything 3 single-image depth, MoGe depth-scale alignment, official defaults guidance 5.0 / shift 5.0 / 50 steps / 480x832 / 16 fps), producing the zoom-in + zoom-out exploration video; step 2 is the official `vipe_da3_gs_recon` (VIPE pose estimation + DA3 depth + Gaussian reconstruction, chunked recon mode with the official chunk settings when the video exceeds 500 frames), producing `reconstructed_scene.ply` and a rendered camera flythrough. The runner passes the official `--offload` and `--offload_when_prompt` flags so the diffusion transformer, the umt5-xxl T5 encoder, and the VAE caches drop to system RAM between uses.

**Command syntax:**
```
voder.py eva ttw explorify "scene.png" [desc "scene caption"] [trajectory <name>] [direction <left|right|up|down>] [strength N] [duration N] [seed 0] [fast]
voder.py eva ttw explorify desc "a medieval castle on a hill at sunset" (TTI overdose generates the seed image first)
```

**Output:** a result folder `voder_eva_ttw_explorify_<desc>_<timestamp>/` with `reconstructed_scene.ply` (the scene — import it into Blender via a 3DGS add-on or engine splat plugins), `exploration_video.mp4` (the generated walkthrough), and `camera_flythrough.mp4` (the render of the reconstructed scene along the trajectory). `fast` enables the official DMD distillation LoRA (4 sampling steps, ~15× faster, lower prompt fidelity — the official recommendation for best quality is without it).

**Resources:** the most demanding model in VODER — official reference point is an H100 80GB with CUDA 12.8; ~70GB of checkpoints auto-download on first use into `src/models/checkpoints/lyra2/`; Linux + NVIDIA GPU required, no CPU mode. `python setup.py --envs lyra2` installs the inference-only subset of the official requirements plus the compiled extras (flash-attn 2.6.3, transformer_engine, gsplat at the official pinned commit, MoGe, and the vendored VIPE package).

**Interactive CLI:** TTW menu option `3. Explorify` asks for the input image only (path or URL) — the one-line mode gets everything (input, desc, camera keywords).

**Files:**
- New: `src/lyra2/` — vendored Lyra 2.0 inference sources (`lyra_2/` package with the VIPE and Depth Anything 3 submodules at their official in-package locations, licenses included)
- New: `src/envs/lyra2/` — isolated venv folder (inference-only subset of the official requirements)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/world/lyra.py` — `Lyra2Wrapper` (input resolution through the shared media layer, desc → TTI overdose seed-image chain, camera keyword validation, official trajectory constants)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_runners/lyra2_runner.py` — checkpoint self-healing download, official two-step subprocess pipeline, frame snapping, chunked recon, result collection
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — `explorify` added to `EVA_SUB_MODES`, `overdose edit nbg` / `overdose gen nbg` parsing, `explorify` routing in `_eva_ttw` with the platform-URL gate and explorify keyword pre-parser, usage strings updated. No in-code comments.
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/image/qwen.py` — `edit_nbg` method (RGBA edit through the shared runner protocol)
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_runners/qwen-image2.1-uc_runner.py` — `edit_nbg` action (official RGBA prompt wrapper on the edit workflow, opaque-output warning)
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_paths.py` — `LYRA2_DIR` checkpoint path
- Modified: `src/voders/DLCs/eva/_envrunner.py` — `lyra2` registered in `EVA_RUNNERS`
- Modified: `setup.py` — `lyra2` registered in `EVA_ENVS` with a post-install step (transformer_engine, MoGe, gsplat pinned commit, flash-attn 2.6.3, vendored VIPE editable install, cudart symlink)
- Modified: `src/voders/interactiveCLI/__init__.py` — TTW interactive menu option 3 (explorify, input only)
- Modified: `README.md`, `docs/Guide.md`, `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md`, `docs/READ.md`, `docs/Languages.md` — same in-place doc updates as the overdose section above, extended for explorify

## 08/20/2026
- Status: In development — Project Eva DLC
- **Project Eva — the expansion DLC for VODER**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HAKORADev/VODER/main/src/eva.png" alt="Project Eva" width="400"/>

### Project Eva

Project Eva is VODER's first DLC (Downloadable Content) expansion. It extends VODER beyond audio into image, video, chat, and world generation — all under the same engine, same infrastructure, same CLI patterns. Eva is NOT a standalone app; it lives inside VODER as `voders/DLCs/eva/` and uses the same model download/cache/load/unload patterns as every other VODER feature.

**The DLC system** is the real foundation of this update. A new `voders/DLCs/` folder houses expansion packs. Each DLC registers its modes, and VODER routes to them via `voder.py eva <mode>`. The interactive CLI gets a new option `0. DLCs` that opens a DLC submenu. Future DLCs (like Klarify) plug into the same system.

**Eva modes:**

| Mode | Name | Sub-modes | Model |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| `tti` | Text-to-Image | gen, edit, nbg (transparent PNG) | Flux 2 Dev |
| `ttv` | Text-to-Video | gen (with audio), animify, edit, lipsync | MiniMax H3 (gen), Wan 2.2 Animate 14B (animify), Wan 2.1 VACE 14B (edit), Wan 2.2 S2V 14B (lipsync) |
| `ttt` | Text-to-Text (VADAR) | gen (chat) | Gemma 4 12B (abliterated, GGUF via Ollama) |
| `ttw` | Text-to-World | gen, edit objectify (retexture), objectify (image→3D) | Tencent HY-World 2.0 (gen), Microsoft TRELLIS.2 (edit objectify/objectify) |

**Supporting models:**
- **SAM 3.1** (facebook/sam3.1) — segmentation for image/video editing masks
- **SigLIP 2 giant** (google/siglip2-giant-opt-patch16-384) — vision encoder for feature extraction

**VADAR reborn:** The chat model from the old VADAR agent system is back — but stripped down to just chat. No agent loop, no brotherhood, no tools, no Eval, no Catcher, no Summarizer. Just Gemma 4 12B (abliterated uncensored) via Ollama, with streaming responses, dynamic context window calculation, and personality files. Interactive CLI focused — type `voder.py eva ttt` to enter chat mode, or `voder.py eva ttt gen "how are you"` for a one-shot response.

**Command syntax:**
```
voder.py eva tti gen "a cyberpunk city at night" [resolution "1024x1024"] [seed 0]
voder.py eva tti edit "input.png" desc "add a red sky" [reference "ref.png"] [resolution "1024x1024"]
voder.py eva tti nbg "a character standing" [resolution "1024x1024"]
voder.py eva ttv gen "a cat playing piano" [duration 10] [resolution "1280x720"]
voder.py eva ttv animify "character.png" [desc "..."] reference "pose.mp4"
voder.py eva ttv edit "input.mp4" desc "make it night time" [reference "ref.mp4"] [duration 5]
voder.py eva ttv lipsync "face.png" [desc "..."] reference "voice.wav"
voder.py eva ttt gen "how are you?"
voder.py eva ttt  (enters interactive chat mode)
voder.py eva ttw gen "a medieval castle on a hill"
voder.py eva ttw edit objectify "character.glb" reference "texture.png"
voder.py eva ttw objectify "character.png"
```

**All Eva modes support:**
- The `result` keyword (bare names, `.auto`, quoted paths — same as VODER modes)
- `&&` extended commands with the Dimensions Resolver
- Chains integration
- Output naming: `voder_eva_<mode>_<sub_mode>_<description>_<timestamp>.<format>`

**Interactive CLI:** Option `0. DLCs` → `1. Eva` → `1-4` (TTI, TTV, TTT, TTW). Each mode has its own interactive submenu with step-by-step prompts. TTT goes directly to VADAR's streaming chat.

**Model integration patterns:**
- **Diffusers-native** (Flux 2 Dev, SigLIP 2): Direct `from_pretrained` loading, same as other VODER models
- **Ollama subprocess** (VADAR/Gemma 4): GGUF model registered via `ollama create`, inference via `ollama.chat()` with streaming
- **Custom pipeline** (MiniMax H3, Wan 2.1 VACE, Wan 2.2 Animate, Wan 2.2 S2V, HY-World 2.0, TRELLIS.2): Loads via custom pipeline classes, with source code vendored under `src/{h3,wan21,wan22,hyworld2,trellis2}/`
- **Isolated venvs**: Each Eva model runs in its own Python venv under `src/envs/<model>/` (flux2, h3, animate, vace, s2v, hyworld, trellis, sam3, siglip2). Each venv installs per its official requirements with no version conflicts. Wrappers shell out via a JSON-spec protocol.

**Uncensored:** All models use uncensored/abliterated variants where available. VADAR uses the abliterated Gemma 4 12B GGUF. Other models are used as-is from their official repos.

**Downscaling:** Images and videos that exceed a model's maximum resolution are automatically downscaled using a high-quality LANCZOS resampling method (ported from the Klarity project).

### Klarify DLC

Klarify is VODER's second DLC. It integrates the [Klarity](https://github.com/HAKORADev/klarity) project's upscaling, enhancement, and frame interpolation into VODER's DLC system.

**Modes:**
- `klarify upscale` — Upscale x4 with Real-HAT-GAN-sharper, then -2 with LANCZOS. Double pixels with x4 quality without fine-artifacts. Images and videos.
- `klarify enhance` — Denoise (NAFNet-SIDD-width64) + Deblur (NAFNet-GoPro-width64) in one pass. Images and videos.
- `klarify interpolate` — Frame interpolation with RIFE v4.25. Multiplies FPS by N (default 2). Videos only.

**Models (heavy/SOTA only, no lite variant):**
- NAFNet-SIDD-width64 (denoise) — ~440MB
- NAFNet-GoPro-width64 (deblur) — ~260MB
- Real-HAT-GAN-sharper (upscale) — ~167MB
- RIFE v4.25 (interpolation) — ~21MB

All models auto-downloaded from Google Drive on first use. Same cache/load/unload pattern as all VODER models. CPU and GPU supported.

**Multi-step workflow:** For the full treatment on a video (enhance → upscale → interpolate), chain with `&&`:
```
python voder.py klarify enhance "input.mp4" result step1.auto "&&" klarify upscale "results/step1.mp4" result step2.auto "&&" klarify interpolate "results/step2.mp4" result final.auto
```

**DLC results directory:** All DLC outputs now go to `results/DLCs/<dlc_name>/` instead of flat in `results/`. Eva outputs go to `results/DLCs/eva/`, Klarify outputs go to `results/DLCs/klarify/`.

**Files:**
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/klarify/__init__.py` — Klarify DLC registration
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/klarify/klarify_engine.py` — All model loading, processing, and cleanup logic
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/klarify/nafnet_arch.py` — NAFNet architecture (denoise + deblur)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/klarify/hat_gan_arch.py` — HAT architecture (upscale)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/klarify/rife_arch.py` — RIFE architecture (interpolation)
- New: `src/voders/DLCs/klarify/sr_arch.py` — SR VGG architecture (fallback)
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — added `KLARIFY_MODES`, `oneline_klarify()`, klarify arg parsing, `klarify` in valid_modes, `EVA_RESULTS_DIR` changed to `results/DLCs/eva`
- Modified: `src/voders/interactiveCLI/__init__.py` — DLC menu now shows both Eva and Klarify, added `_klarify_mode_menu()` and `_klarify_interactive()`

## 08/16/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Extreme text-to-song model addition — MiniMax Music 3**

### Extreme TTM — MiniMax Music 3 integration

Added [MiniMax Music 3](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-Music3) as the `extreme` mode for TTM (Text-to-Music). MiniMax Music 3 is a high-performance music generation model that creates complete songs up to **5 minutes** long with expressive vocals, evolving arrangements, and stable long-form audio quality.

**Architecture:** 8B Global LLM (Qwen3-8B) for long-range musical structure + 0.6B Local LLM for frame-level acoustic detail + continuous hidden-state synthesis (Flow Matching + Flow-VAE). Produces 44.1 kHz, 16-bit stereo WAV.

**Vendored source:** The MiniMax Music 3 pipeline classes (~1680 lines across 10 files) were vendored from diffusers 0.40.0.dev0 into `src/music3/` with all relative imports rewritten to absolute `from diffusers...` imports. This allows VODER to use the model with the stable diffusers 0.39.0 from PyPI — no need to install diffusers from GitHub. The vendored classes import base classes (`ModelMixin`, `ConfigMixin`, `ModularPipeline`, `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler`, `ClassifierFreeGuidance`, etc.) from the installed diffusers, which are all present in 0.39.0.

**Usage:**
```
# Bare generation — full song with lyrics
python voder.py ttm extreme lyrics "[verse]\nHello world" styling "warm acoustic pop" 60

# BGM replacement — replace background music in existing audio
python voder.py ttm extreme bgm "podcast.wav" music "lo-fi chill" level 25

# TTS with extreme background music
python voder.py tts script "Hello" voice "narrator" music extreme "epic orchestral"
```

**Lyrics section tags:** `[intro]`, `[verse]`, `[pre-chorus]`, `[chorus]`, `[post-chorus]`, `[bridge]`, `[instrumental]`, `[solo]`, `[outro]`, plus custom tags like `[bass-drop]`. Tags must be on their own line — text on the same line as a tag is dropped.

**Locked sub-modes:** When `extreme` is active, remix, repaint, complete, lego, and extract are rejected (MiniMax Music 3 does not support source audio manipulation). **VC is supported** because it's a post-generation step — generate song with MiniMax Music 3, extract vocals with SVS, convert with Seed-VC v1, mix back. The VC step doesn't depend on the generation model's capabilities.

**Duration limit:** 10–300 seconds (5 minutes max). The model uses 9000 acoustic frames at 25 Hz frame rate, capped at 360 seconds by the model architecture; VODER caps at 300 seconds for safety.

**Model download:** Cached at `src/models/checkpoints/music3/`. First run downloads ~20GB from HuggingFace (`MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Music3`). Uses the same universal download/cache/load/unload pattern as all other VODER models.

**TTS music extreme:** In TTS dialogue/single mode, `music extreme "<description>"` uses MiniMax Music 3 for background music generation instead of ACE-Step. The generated music is instrumental-only (auto-lyrics: `[intro]`, `[instrumental]`, `[outro]`) to avoid vocal clashing with the spoken dialogue. Music duration matches the spoken dialogue + 5s buffer.

**Language support:** 80+ languages (same tier system as Fish Audio S2-Pro). The Global LLM is Qwen3-8B, which is inherently multilingual. Language is auto-detected from the lyrics text.

**Files:**
- New: `src/music3/` — vendored MiniMax Music 3 pipeline classes (10 Python files + `__init__.py` files, ~1680 lines). Relative imports rewritten to absolute `from diffusers...` / `from music3...` imports. No in-code comments added by VODER (original diffusers comments retained in vendored files).
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — added `MUSIC3_DIR` and related constants, `MiniMaxMusic3Wrapper` class (download, load, generate, cleanup), `oneline_ttm_extreme()`, `oneline_ttm_extreme_vc()`, and `oneline_ttm_extreme_bgm()` functions, TTM extreme routing in `oneline_ttm()` (bare + VC + bgm, with locked sub-modes check excluding VC), TTS music extreme routing in TTS dialogue path, `ttm` added to `extreme` keyword acceptance in arg parser, extreme TTM examples in usage help. No in-code comments.
- Modified: `README.md` — added MiniMax Music 3 to models table.
- Modified: `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md` — new section 3c "Extreme TTM — MiniMax Music 3" with full syntax, lyrics section tags table, music description guide, locked sub-modes list (VC explicitly supported), TTS music extreme docs, and examples including VC.
- Modified: `docs/Languages.md` — added MiniMax Music 3 to overview table and new detailed section with language support, lyrics tags, and notes.
- Modified: `docs/Guide.md` — added TTM extreme, TTM extreme + VC, TTM extreme bgm, and TTS extreme + music extreme rows to the system requirements table; added "Extreme Mode (MiniMax Music 3)" section under TTM with comparison table vs ACE-Step, VC support explanation, and lyrics tags.

- **Bugfix: local file paths treated as URLs (issue #1)**

### Bugfix: `is_supported_url()` treated local file paths as URLs

**Reported in [issue #1](https://github.com/HAKORADev/VODER/issues/1):** running `python src/voder.py se "/home/user/file.wav"` failed with `Error: Error checking video: Invalid URL 'https:///home/user/file.wav': No host supplied`. SE (and any mode using `resolve_target_to_audio`) was treating local file paths as URLs and trying to download them.

**Root cause:** The `is_supported_url()` function called `_normalize_url()` which prepends `https://` to ANY string without a URL scheme — including local file paths like `/home/user/file.wav`. So `is_supported_url("/home/user/file.wav")` returned `True`, causing the URL download path to activate. The `_normalize_url` helper was designed for URL normalization (e.g., turning `youtube.com/watch?v=...` into `https://youtube.com/watch?v=...`), but it didn't distinguish between URLs and local paths.

**Fix:** Rewrote `is_supported_url()` to explicitly reject local file paths before checking for URL patterns:
- Absolute paths: starting with `/` or `\`
- Windows drive letters: `C:\` or `C:/`
- Relative paths: `./`, `../`, `.\`, `..\`
- Files that exist on disk (`os.path.exists(url)` returns `True`)
- Bare filenames with extensions (e.g., `test.wav`)

Only strings that pass these local-path checks AND look like URLs (start with `http://`/`https://`, have a `://` scheme, or match a known platform domain) return `True`.

Same fix applied to `classify_url()` which had the same `_normalize_url` bug — it was classifying local paths as `public_net`.

**Verified with 15 test cases:** the issue scenario (`/home/user/Projects/VODER/test.wav`), files that exist on disk, bare filenames, relative paths, Windows paths (forward and backslash), and all URL types (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, short URLs, public_net, URLs without protocol).

**Files:**
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — rewrote `is_supported_url()` (lines 266–284), added local-path guard to `classify_url()` (line 296). No in-code comments.

### public_net restricted to quest download and media-search only

**Follow-up to issue #1 fix:** beyond fixing the local-path-as-URL bug, public_net URLs (URLs from unsupported platforms like `https://example.com/video`) are now rejected by all main processing modes (TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS), voice training, chains, and dialogue source analysis.

**Why:** if a user typos a file path (e.g., `rsults/file.wav` instead of `results/file.wav`), the old code might try to treat it as a URL and attempt a download. By restricting public_net to `quest download` and `quest media-search` only, modes will simply report "file not found" for typos instead of making confusing network attempts.

**The workflow for unsupported-platform content:**
1. Download with quest download: `python voder.py quest download "https://example.com/video" result myfile.auto`
2. Use the local file in any mode: `python voder.py se results/myfile.wav`
3. Or chain with `&&`: `python voder.py quest download "https://example.com/video" result myfile.auto "&&" se results/myfile.wav result clean.auto`

**Implementation:**
- New: `is_known_platform_url(url)` — returns `True` only for the 8 supported platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, Reddit). Returns `False` for public_net URLs.
- Modified: `resolve_target_to_audio()` — now checks `is_known_platform_url()` after `is_supported_url()`. If the URL is public_net, rejects with a helpful 5-line error message telling the user to use `quest download` first.
- Modified: `validate_dialogue_source_file()` — same public_net rejection for dialogue source analysis.
- Unchanged: `quest download` and `quest media-search` — still accept public_net URLs with the existing warning.
- Unchanged: `is_supported_url()` — still correctly identifies URLs vs local paths (from the issue #1 fix). Arg parsers use it to distinguish URLs from keywords, which is fine. The rejection happens at the mode entry point (`resolve_target_to_audio`), not at arg parsing.

**Files:**
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — added `is_known_platform_url()` function, added public_net rejection to `resolve_target_to_audio()` and `validate_dialogue_source_file()`. No in-code comments.
- Modified: `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md` — Input Types section updated with "Supported platforms only in modes" note, public_net workflow explanation, and fixed the stale `url_handler.py` reference (now points to inline functions in `voder.py`).

## 07/16/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **VADAR funeral + aftermath — agent layer removed, dependencies reverted, TTS voice clone limits enforced, dimensions resolver with paradox/mandela detection**

### Reverted: transformers and huggingface-hub to pre-VADAR versions

The 07/08 commit `3fc81cd "Vendor dac + upgrade transformers to 5.x for Gemma4Unified tokenizer support"` bumped two dependencies specifically because VADAR needed them:

- `transformers==4.57.3` → `transformers>=5.0.0` — VADAR required 5.x for the Gemma4Unified tokenizer
- `huggingface-hub==0.34.0` → `huggingface-hub>=1.0.0` — required by transformers 5.x

With VADAR removed, these bumps are no longer needed. Reverted to the pre-VADAR pinned versions:

- `transformers>=5.0.0` → `transformers==4.57.3`
- `huggingface-hub>=1.0.0` → `huggingface-hub==0.34.0`

The 07/08 commit note explicitly warned: *"VibeVoice and Qwen-TTS use deep transformers internal APIs that may have moved in 5.x. These will need testing and possibly patching when the models are loaded with transformers 5.x installed."* Reverting to 4.57.3 eliminates this latent risk — VibeVoice and Qwen-TTS were never re-tested against 5.x, so going back to the version they were built against is the safe call.

### Not reverted: dac vendoring

The 07/08 commit also vendored `dac` into `src/libs/dac/` and replaced the `dac` + `descript-audio-codec==1.0.0` requirements with `descript-audiotools>=0.7.2`. This was a side-effect of the transformers 5.x conflict (dac pins `typer~=0.15.2`, transformers 5.x needs `typer>=0.26`).

The vendored dac does not depend on transformers, so it works fine with either transformers 4.x or 5.x. Keeping the vendored copy is the less invasive option — re-introducing the PyPI `dac` package would require deleting `src/libs/dac/`, removing the `src/libs/` sys.path addition in `voder.py`, and re-testing every code path that imports from `dac.` (Fish-Speech, Qwen-TTS, AudioSR). That can be a separate follow-up if desired.

### Files

- Modified: `requirements.txt` — reverted `transformers` and `huggingface-hub` to pre-VADAR pinned versions.

### Bugfix: enforce voice clone reference duration limits in TTS engines

Both TTS engines in VODER accept reference audio for voice cloning, but the code had no maximum duration check — a user could pass a 30-minute reference audio and the engine would try to feed it all to the model, eventually crashing when the encoded reference exceeded the model's context window.

The actual hard limits are determined by each model's context window (32768 tokens), NOT by the hosted-API caps (DashScope's 60s, SGLang-Omni's 30s) — VODER runs the open-source local models, not the hosted APIs. Calculated from the model configs and codec frame rates:

- **Qwen3-TTS** (regular `tts` mode): `max_position_embeddings = 32768` tokens at 12.5 Hz frame rate = ~43.7 min total context. Capped at **1200s (20 min)** so the reference leaves at least ~20 min of context for text + generation.
- **Fish S2-Pro** (`tts extreme` mode): `text_config.max_seq_len = 32768` tokens at ~21 Hz = ~26 min total context, minus 2048 tokens reserved for generation (enforced by `inference.py`). Capped at **600s (10 min)** — leaves comfortable headroom for generation.

These caps are intentionally generous (not the 10-30s "quality recommendation" range) because VODER supports use cases like cloning a voice from a long video with many speaker samples — generic 30s caps would defeat the purpose.

Added a core helper `_enforce_voice_clone_limit(audio_path, max_seconds, engine_label)` that:
1. Reads the audio duration via `torchaudio.info`
2. If duration ≤ limit: returns the original path unchanged (no cost)
3. If duration > limit: loads the first `max_seconds` of audio, saves to a temp WAV, returns the truncated path (temp file is added to a cleanup list)
4. On any error: falls back to the original audio with a warning (never blocks the pipeline)

The helper is called at the start of `QwenTTS.extract_voice()` (limit = 1200s) and `FishTTS.encode_voice()` (limit = 600s). These are the two lowest-level voice clone entry points — every path flows through them:

- Single reference `tts ... target "ref.wav"` → `extract_voice` ✓
- Multi-reference `tts ... target "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav"` → `_compose_refs` → `extract_voice` ✓
- `train voice:name "ref.wav"` → `extract_voice` or `encode_voice` ✓
- `train voice:name "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav"` → `_resolve_multi_refs` (concatenates without cap) → `extract_voice` or `encode_voice` ✓ (truncation happens at the engine)
- Dialogue mode voice cloning → `extract_voice` ✓
- TTS dub / SLC / SVC voice cloning → `extract_voice` or `encode_voice` ✓
- `_tts_extract_voice` dispatcher → routes to `extract_voice` or `encode_voice` ✓

The limits are defined as module-level constants near the top of `voder.py`:
- `QWEN3_TTS_VOICE_CLONE_MAX_SECONDS = 1200`
- `FISH_S2PRO_VOICE_CLONE_MAX_SECONDS = 600`

When truncation occurs, a message is printed: `[Qwen3-TTS] Voice clone reference is 1800.0s — truncating to 1200s (model limit)...` so the user knows their reference was clipped.

**Files:**
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — added `QWEN3_TTS_VOICE_CLONE_MAX_SECONDS` and `FISH_S2PRO_VOICE_CLONE_MAX_SECONDS` constants, added `_enforce_voice_clone_limit()` core helper, wired it into `QwenTTS.extract_voice()` and `FishTTS.encode_voice()`. No in-code comments.

### Dimensions Resolver — extended commands (`&&`) with real bidirectional execution

Extended commands (`&&`) have been upgraded from a simple linear sequencer to a full **dependency resolver**. Each `&&`-separated command is treated as a **dimension** — an independent entity with inputs and outputs. The Dimensions Resolver builds a dependency graph, validates it, and executes commands in the optimal order.

#### What changed

**Before:** `&&` split commands and ran them in written order (1 → 2 → 3). The "bidirectional" claim was marketing — it just meant "command 3 can reference command 1's output," which `chains` already did.

**After:** `&&` commands are parsed for their inputs (any `results/` path reference) and outputs (via `result <name>`). The resolver builds a dependency graph, detects three classes of errors, ranks commands into execution levels via topological sort, and runs them level-by-level with mode batching. Users can now write commands in **any order** — including forward references where command 1 uses a file that command 4 will produce — and the resolver figures out the correct execution sequence.

#### The resolver pipeline

1. **Parse dimensions** — each `&&`-separated command is wrapped in a `_CommandDimension` object that extracts its mode, outputs (from `result <name>`), and input references (any arg containing a `results/` path)
2. **Output registry** — build a map of (stem, location) → command index. Detect **OUTPUT CONFLICT** if two commands produce the same name in the same location
3. **Dependency graph** — for each command, match its input references against the output registry. If command B references a file that command A produces, B depends on A
4. **Mandela detection** — if a command references a file in `results/` that no command produces and doesn't exist on disk, refuse with a **MANDELA ERROR** ("a file that will never exist")
5. **Paradox detection** — topological sort (Kahn's algorithm). If the sort fails (cycle detected), refuse with a **PARADOX ERROR** listing the circular dependencies
6. **Level ranking** — commands with no dependencies are level 1; commands depending on level 1 outputs are level 2; etc.
7. **Mode-batched execution** — within each level, group commands by mode (all STS together, all TTS together, etc.) to minimize model load/unload thrash. Run level by level — all level 1 commands finish before level 2 starts

#### Error types

- **OUTPUT CONFLICT** — two commands produce the same file name in the same location
- **MANDELA ERROR** — a command references a file in `results/` that no command produces and doesn't exist on disk. "Someone believed a thing happened but it was never."
- **PARADOX ERROR** — circular dependency. Command A waits for B, B waits for A (or a longer cycle).

#### Example: forward reference

```bash
python voder.py sts base results/vocals.wav target results/orig.wav result cover.auto "&&" tts script "hello" result orig.auto "&&" svs results/orig.wav voice result vocals.auto
```

The user writes STS first, but STS needs outputs from TTS and SVS. The resolver sees:
- Step 1 (STS): needs `results/vocals.wav` (step 3) and `results/orig.wav` (step 2)
- Step 2 (TTS): no dependencies
- Step 3 (SVS): needs `results/orig.wav` (step 2)

Execution plan: Level 1: step 2 (TTS) → Level 2: step 3 (SVS) → Level 3: step 1 (STS). The user wrote `STS && TTS && SVS` but VODER ran `TTS → SVS → STS`.

#### Smarter `result` keyword

The `result` keyword now supports bare names (no quotes, no path) for in-place naming:

| Syntax | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `result file-name` | Copy latest output to `results/file-name` — **literal, no extension** (file saved with exactly the name given) |
| `result file-name.mp3` | Copy to `results/file-name.mp3` — extension as written (no conversion) |
| `result file-name.auto` | Copy to `results/file-name.<real_ext>` — `.auto` is the ONLY magic suffix, replaced with the engine's actual extension |
| `result "path/to/file"` | Copy to that path (old behavior preserved) |

**Why literal by default?** To ensure the user knows the exact file name. VODER prints `Result saved as: results/file1` so the user knows the path for the next `&&` segment. If you want the engine's real extension, use `.auto`.

#### Implementation

- New: `_CommandDimension` class — extracts inputs/outputs from a command's arg list. Scans for `result <name>` (output) and any arg containing a `results/` path (input). Normalizes paths for matching (stem + location, extension-agnostic).
- New: `_run_extended_commands()` — the resolver entry point. Splits on `&&`, creates dimensions, builds output registry, constructs dependency graph, runs Mandela + Paradox detection, topological sort into levels, mode-batched execution via `parse_and_execute_oneline`.
- Rewritten: `copy_result_to_path()` — searches `results/` recursively for the latest file (was top-level only — broke for quest outputs in `results/downloads/`), classifies result argument as bare name (no `/`) vs path (has `/`), applies extension logic.
- Modified: `oneline_quest()` now passes `result_path=None` to quests — `copy_result_to_path()` handles all result naming uniformly (fixes a pre-existing double-copy bug).
- Modified: `__main__` `&&` handling simplified to call `_run_extended_commands()`.

**Files:**
- Modified: `src/voder.py` — added `_CommandDimension` class and `_run_extended_commands()` resolver (~190 lines), rewrote `copy_result_to_path()`, simplified `__main__` `&&` handling. No in-code comments.
- Modified: `src/voders/sidequests.py` — `oneline_quest()` now passes `result_path=None` to quests. No in-code comments.
- Modified: `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md` — section 10b rewritten with the real dimension resolver architecture, 5 examples (forward reference, mode batching, deep chain, chains mix, quest pipeline), 3 error types (output conflict, Mandela, paradox), and an updated comparison table vs `chains`.

### VADAR funeral

After 9 rounds of deep gap analysis and the VADAR twins (heavy/lite) build, an honest cost/benefit review concluded that the VODER brotherhood (VADAR + Eval + Summarizer + Catcher) was over-engineered for what it delivered. Most of its machinery existed to support itself, not to serve real VODER users. The decision: kill the agent layer entirely, salvage the few pieces that had standalone value as plain VODER features.

This entry does both: it ships the salvage (`quest media-search` + `quest download` improvements) AND removes the entire agent system in a single commit.

### VADAR brotherhood removed

The entire VODER agent system has been deleted. Everything below is gone:

- **`src/voders/vadars/` folder** — deleted entirely. This contained `vadar.py` (main agent loop), `eval.py` (Eval brother), `summarizer.py` (Summarizer brother), `catcher.py` (Catcher brother), `system_prompt.py`, `context.py`, `stream_parser.py`, `tools/` (validator + 22 tool implementations), `config.json`, `about/` (personality/roleplay/user/how-to-respond markdown files), `supported_libs.txt`, `sessions/` (runtime), `memories/` (runtime), `ping-time.txt`, and `global_context.txt`.
- **`voder.py`** — removed:
  - All VADAR constants and config (`HEAVY_VADAR_MODEL_DIR`, `LITE_VADAR_MODEL_DIR`, `VADAR_CONFIG_PATH`, `_VADAR_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`, `_VADAR_CONFIG`, `vadar_load_config`)
  - All VADAR model functions: `vadar_load_model`, `vadar_run_inference`, `vadar_run_inference_streamed`, `lite_vadar_load_model`, `lite_vadar_run_inference`, `lite_vadar_run_inference_streamed`, `vadar_check_model_downloaded`, `lite_vadar_check_model_downloaded`, `_calculate_dynamic_context`, `_ensure_ollama_running`, `_ollama_model_exists`, `_parse_lite_thinking`
  - The `vadar` mode in oneline arg parsing (and the `overdose vadar` routing)
  - The `vadar` mode in `valid_modes` list
  - The `vadar` line in `show_oneline_usage()`
  - The `elif mode == 'vadar'` dispatch branch in `parse_and_execute_oneline`
  - The `if mode != 'vadar'` guard around `organize_results()`
  - ~510 lines of code removed in total from `voder.py`
- **`src/voders/interactiveCLI/__init__.py`** — removed mode 10 (`_cli_vadar_mode` function, dispatch table entry, menu print line, input prompt `1-10` → `1-9`, invalid-choice message). Interactive CLI menu is now 1–9 (TTS, STS, TTM, SE, SFX, SVS, STT, SS, Chains).
- **`setup.py`** — removed `install_ollama()` and `ensure_ollama_running()` functions, removed the Ollama install step, removed Ollama verification, removed the VADAR quick-start examples. Step count went from 5 to 4.
- **`requirements.txt`** — removed `ollama>=0.4.0` (was VADAR-only).
- **`.gitignore`** — removed the `src/voders/vadars/sessions/*` and `src/voders/vadars/memories/*` rules (folder no longer exists).

**Dependencies kept (still used by other features):**
- `transformers>=5.0.0` — used by Whisper STT, Qwen TTS, other pipelines
- `torch==2.8.0` — pervasive across the codebase
- `gallery-dl>=1.27.0` — used by `quest download image` and `quest media-search`
- `yt-dlp>=2026.3.17` — used by `quest download` and `quest media-search`

### Documentation cleaned

All VADAR/brotherhood references removed from the non-historical docs. The historical CHANGELOG entries (07/07 "VADAR — a new warrior" and the salvage note above) are preserved as the historical record.

- `README.md` — removed VADAR feature bullet, VADAR sub-section, Ollama install line, VADAR quick-start examples, VADAR rows in tasks/models tables (~39 lines)
- `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md` — removed the entire `## 11. vadar` section (~170 lines) plus VADAR mentions in the intro and overview
- `docs/READ.md` — removed VADAR model setup section, VADAR TOC entry, the entire `## VADAR (vadar) — the natural-language agent` section, VADAR bullets in features/AI-integration lists (~100 lines)
- `docs/voder-skill.md` — removed the entire `## 2.11 VADAR` section (~94 lines) plus VADAR mentions in the overview
- `docs/Bots.md` — removed the entire `## VADAR — Your New Friend` section (~87 lines) plus the TOC entry and feature bullet
- `docs/Guide.md` — removed the entire `### VADAR (vadar)` sub-section (~178 lines), the entire `## VADAR Brotherhood — System Requirements & Status` section (~68 lines), in-flow VADAR mentions (~250 lines total)
- `docs/FAQ.md` — already VADAR-free, no change
- `docs/Languages.md` — already VADAR-free (the "Evaluated" match was a false positive), no change

### New side-quest: `quest media-search`

A new side-quest for searching media across platforms — the only VADAR tool that had real standalone value. It replaces the agent-only `search_media` internal tool with a proper VODER side-quest that any user can call.

**Syntax:**

```
python voder.py quest media-search [image] <platform(s)> "<query>" [count] [result "<path>"]
```

- **Engine selection**:
  - No `image` keyword → **yt-dlp** search (video/audio platforms: YouTube, Reddit, Bilibili, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter; unknown names attempted as `public_net`).
  - `image` keyword → **gallery-dl** search (image platforms: Instagram, Pixiv, Danbooru, Gelbooru, Yandere, Konachan, Reddit, Twitter/X, Flickr, Pinterest, ArtStation, DeviantArt, Tumblr, Wallhaven, Unsplash, Behance, 500px, Imgur, VK, Weibo; unknown names attempted as `public_net`).
- **Multi-platform**: separate platforms with `/` (e.g., `youtube/reddit`, `pixiv/danbooru/gelbooru`). The search runs **per platform**, with `<count>` applied as the per-platform cap. Results from all platforms are combined into a single list file. Duplicates are removed.
- **Count**: integer 1–100, default 20. Out-of-range or non-integer values error out. This is a per-platform cap, not a guarantee — if a platform returns fewer results, you get fewer.
- **Cookies retry**: yt-dlp and gallery-dl searches that fail or return nothing are automatically retried with Chrome → Brave → Edge cookies (same mechanism as `quest download`). Useful for login-walled search pages (Instagram hashtag search, some Pixiv tag content, etc.).
- **No results = no file**: if every platform returns zero results, no list file is created. A per-platform summary is printed to the terminal so the user can see which platforms failed and why.
- **Output**: `results/downloads/others/voder_quest_media-search_<engine>_<platforms>_<query>_<timestamp>.txt` — header with metadata + per-platform summary + per-entry details (title, URL, extractor/platform, type, duration/dimensions).

**Pair with `quest download`**: the list file contains URLs ready to be fetched with `quest download "<url>"` (audio), `quest download video "<url>"` (video), or `quest download image "<url>"` (image).

### `quest download` improvements

- **URL extension auto-detection**: when no `video`/`image` keyword is given and the URL ends in a known image extension (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.svg`), the URL is auto-routed to the image path. URLs ending in a known video extension (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.flv`, `.m4v`, `.wmv`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.3gp`) are auto-routed to the video path. Covers direct file links where the format is in the URL — no need to remember the keyword.
- **Helpful error messages on ambiguity**: when a URL without a clear extension fails the default audio path, the error message now suggests the right keyword to use (`image` or `video`). Same for video path failures — it suggests `image` or plain (audio). This addresses the `public_net` side-effect where the URL might not contain the file format and the user doesn't know which keyword to use.

### Side-quest categorization

Side-quests are now organized into two top-level categories (defined in `src/voders/quests_categories.py`):

- **Media Discovery** — `download`, `media-search` (the fetch utilities)
- **Media Manipulation** — the other 17 quests, split into **Sound Effects**, **Audio Editing**, **Format & File** (unchanged)

Previously `download` stood alone at the top of the listing as "standalone"; now it has a sibling. The new category is purely organizational — every side-quest is still called by its unique name (`quest <name> ...`), with no prefix.

### Documentation

- `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md`:
  - New section **9.2 `media-search`** with full syntax, behavior, supported platforms list, and examples (renumbered 9.2–9.17 → 9.3–9.18 to make room).
  - Updated section **9.1 `download`** with the new `image` keyword row in the argument table, the auto-detection behavior, and examples for direct image/video URLs.
  - Updated the side-quests overview table to show the new `Media Discovery` category and the auto-detection note in `download`'s description.
  - Public-net download support was already documented (line 1731) — no change needed there.

- **VADAR twins wins — Ollama-powered lite VADAR + setup.py installer**

### VADAR twins

VADAR now comes in two variants — twins with the same brain but different senses:

| Feature | Heavy VADAR (overdose) | Lite VADAR |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Model | Gemma 4 12B abliterated uncensored (full precision) | SuperGemma 4 12B abliterated (GGUF Q4_K_M, 4-bit quantized) |
| Engine | transformers + torch (native) | Ollama (auto GPU offload, no manual CUDA builds) |
| Multimodal | Yes — look/listen/watch (image, audio, video) | No — text only, blind and deaf |
| VRAM/RAM | 80GB+ (A100 80GB or 32+ core CPU with 80GB+ RAM) | 16GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, or any T4/L4/RTX GPU |
| Model size | ~24GB | ~7GB |
| GPU support | Via transformers (bfloat16, device_map=auto) | Via Ollama (automatic GPU detection + offload) |

### Ollama integration

Lite VADAR now uses **Ollama** instead of llama-cpp-python. Ollama handles GPU detection, model loading, and inference automatically — no manual CUDA builds, no CMAKE_ARGS, no wheel hunting.

- The GGUF model is downloaded on first run and registered with Ollama as `vadar-lite`
- Ollama auto-detects CUDA GPUs and offloads model layers automatically
- Dynamic context window is passed to Ollama via Modelfile `PARAMETER num_ctx`
- The Python `ollama` library is used for chat completions (streaming + non-streaming)
- Model-level chain-of-thought (`<|channel>thought` tokens) is stripped from responses

### setup.py — automated installer

New `setup.py` script automates the entire VODER installation:

1. **System packages**: detects package manager (apt, pacman, dnf, yum, zypper, brew, winget, choco) and installs `ffmpeg` + `sox` automatically
2. **Ollama**: installs Ollama via official scripts (Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`, Windows: `irm https://ollama.com/install.ps1 | iex`)
3. **Python requirements**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Protobuf fix**: `pip install --upgrade protobuf==5.29.6`
5. **Verification**: checks ffmpeg, sox, ollama, torch CUDA availability

Usage: `python setup.py` (after cloning the repo)

### Usage

- **Lite VADAR (default):** `python voder.py vadar "hello there"` — uses Ollama + GGUF. Runs on any machine with 16GB RAM. GPU auto-detected by Ollama.
- **Heavy VADAR (overdose):** `python voder.py overdose vadar "hello there"` — uses the full multimodal model via transformers+torch. Requires 80GB+ RAM/VRAM.
- **Interactive CLI:** When selecting option 10 (VADAR), the user is prompted: "Use overdose VADAR (heavy, multimodal, requires 80GB+ RAM/VRAM)? [y/N]". Default is lite (N).

### What lite VADAR can and cannot do

Lite VADAR is the same agent — same tags, same tools, same eval, same catcher, same summarizer. But it is blind and deaf:

- **Can do:** think, decide, reply, run acts (tts, sts, ttm, stt, se, sfx, svs, ss, train, quest, chains), use tools (read, list, search, memory, calculate, search_media, catalog tools, roleplay tools), be evaluated by Eval, be fixed by Catcher, be summarized by Summarizer.
- **Cannot do:** look at images, listen to audio, watch video, auto-hear inputs. The `look`, `listen`, `watch` tools are removed from the system prompt in lite mode. If the user provides media files, lite VADAR can still run VODER commands on them — it just cannot analyze them itself.

### Architecture

Both twins share the same agent code (`vadar.py`, `eval.py`, `summarizer.py`, `catcher.py`, `context.py`, `system_prompt.py`). The only difference is:
- Model loading: `vadar_load_model()` (heavy, transformers) vs `lite_vadar_load_model()` (lite, Ollama)
- Inference: `vadar_run_inference_streamed()` vs `lite_vadar_run_inference_streamed()`
- System prompt: `is_lite=True` hides `look`/`listen`/`watch` tools and adds a note about lite mode
- Model paths: `models/checkpoints/heavy_vadar/` vs `models/checkpoints/lite_vadar/`
- Lite VADAR registers the GGUF with Ollama via `ollama.create(model='vadar-lite', modelfile=...)`

The `_use_lite_mode` global flag in `vadar.py` routes all inference calls to the correct engine.

### Dependencies

- Added `ollama>=0.4.0` to `requirements.txt` for lite VADAR (Python Ollama client)
- Requires Ollama installed on system — `python setup.py` handles this automatically
- Lite VADAR auto-downloads the GGUF model from `Jiunsong/SuperGemma-4-12b-abliterated-gguf-4bit` on first run
- Model-level thinking is parsed from `<|channel>thought` / `<channel|>` tokens and stripped from responses

### Config

New fields in `config.json` for lite VADAR tuning:
- `lite_gpu_layers`: GPU layers to offload (-1 = all, 0 = CPU only)
- `lite_n_threads`: CPU threads (-1 = auto)
- `lite_repeat_penalty`: repeat penalty for generation (default 1.1)
- `lite_verbose`: verbose llama.cpp output (default false)
- `lite_context_length`: max context tokens. 0 = dynamic (auto-calculate based on available RAM/VRAM). Default: 0 (dynamic)

### Dynamic context window

Lite VADAR uses a **dynamic context window** — it does NOT allocate the full 256K token context upfront. Instead, at model load time, it:

1. Detects available system RAM (via `psutil`)
2. Detects GPU VRAM (via `torch`, if available)
3. Subtracts model size (~7.5 GB) and system overhead (~4 GB)
4. Divides remaining memory by ~0.4 MB/token (KV cache cost for Gemma 4 12B)
5. Rounds to nearest 512, caps at 262,144

This means a 16GB machine gets ~11K context (not 256K), using ~4.5GB for KV cache instead of ~80GB. The context grows naturally with more memory. Set `lite_context_length` in `config.json` to a specific value to override.

## 07/08/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Bug Hunt Activities and Wider Media Support**

### Added — wider media download support

- **gallery-dl integration** for image downloads. VODER now uses [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) alongside yt-dlp to fetch images from supported platforms (Reddit, Instagram, Twitter/X, and others). Added `gallery-dl>=1.27.0` to `requirements.txt`.
- **Reddit platform** support for audio, video, and image downloads. Reddit URLs are now recognized by `detect_platform()` and can be passed to `quest download`, `quest download video`, and `quest download image`.
- **Experimental `public_net` support** — URLs from platforms not in the official supported list (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, Reddit) are no longer hard-rejected. VODER now attempts them via yt-dlp / gallery-dl with a clear warning: `WARNING: This platform is not officially supported. Results may vary — they are untested and we do not know what you may face.` This enables downloads from a much wider range of sites (media-only — no file/yandex-disk/DRM content).
- **Cookies retry mechanism** for both yt-dlp and gallery-dl. When a download fails without cookies, VODER automatically retries with `--cookies-from-browser` cycling through Chrome → Brave → Edge. This dramatically improves success rates on age-restricted, login-walled, or region-locked content.
- **`quest download image "<url>"`** — new keyword `image` alongside the existing `video` keyword. Downloads an image (or image gallery) from a supported URL using gallery-dl.

### Added — results directory reorganization

VODER's `results/` directory is now organized instead of a flat dump:

- **`results/downloads/{images,videos,audios,others}/`** — all `quest download` outputs go here, sorted by media type. No more cluttering the root `results/` folder with downloaded files.
- **`results/<mode>/`** — mode outputs (`voder_tts_*`, `voder_sfx_*`, `voder_ss_*`, etc.) are now also copied into per-mode subfolders (`results/tts/`, `results/sfx/`, `results/ss/`, …) at the end of each run. The original files stay in `results/` root for backwards compatibility — the subfolders are a navigation aid, not a replacement.
- The 8 main modes (tts, sts, ttm, stt, se, sfx, svs, ss) plus `quest` and `chains` each get their own subfolder.

### Enhanced — `search_media` tool overhaul

- `search_media` no longer post-filters results by URL keywords (the old heuristic was unreliable). Instead, it uses yt-dlp's `--flat-playlist --print` with tab-separated metadata fields (title, URL, extractor, duration), then enriches each result with full media info (media type, title, duration, platform, uploader) fetched via `get_url_media_info()`.
- **Reddit** added to `search_media` platforms (uses `redditsearch{N}:query` syntax).
- Results are written to a **list file** at `results/downloads/others/vadar_search_<platform>_<timestamp>.txt` — a structured, readable file VADAR can inspect with the `read` tool (multi-range, line numbers). The file contains one entry per result with all metadata. VADAR no longer needs a separate `get_info` tool — the list file has everything.
- Note: `search_media` does NOT support `public_net` — it only searches the officially supported platforms. For unsupported platforms, the user must provide the direct URL.

### Updated — `download_url_image()` and `get_url_media_info()` in voder.py

- New core function `download_url_image(url, temp_dir=None)` — uses gallery-dl to download images. Includes the cookies retry mechanism. Used by `quest download image` and by VADAR's `look` tool when given an image URL.
- New core function `get_url_media_info(url)` — uses yt-dlp `extract_info(download=False)` and gallery-dl `-j` to fetch metadata without downloading. Used internally by `search_media` to enrich results.

### Updated — VADAR brotherhood internal work

- **Eval brother** — strengthened with full command catalog access, deeper reasoning budget, and smarter evaluation that pushes VADAR toward richer solutions (custom trained `.tts`/`.ttse`, chains, side-quests) instead of surface-level single-mode calls. Eval now thinks and decides before issuing its verdict, with detailed reasoning VADAR can act on.
- **Summarizer brother** — overhauled to handle much larger inputs (full act outputs instead of truncated slices) and produce richer summaries. Now receives act title and command context for accurate condensation.
- **Catcher brother** — re-architected with a two-stage validation pipeline: a fast code-level validator (syntax, path existence, tool registry) catches obvious errors instantly without a model call, and only well-formed calls reach Catcher's AI for deeper inspection. Cleaner terminal feedback with timing and clear OK/FAIL indicators.
- **Context manager** — switched to accurate tokenizer-based token counting (via the loaded model's tokenizer) instead of the rough `len//4` heuristic. Sliding window and memory caps are now precise.
- **Memory system** — when memory reaches the context cap, VADAR is now told explicitly and asked to converse with the user about which memory to free, instead of silent automatic eviction.
- **Global context** — redesigned to summarize all past sessions (not just the latest 5) with clear per-session block markers, so VADAR can distinguish what happened in each session. Oldest blocks are pruned by size, not by count.
- **Interactive ping** — reworked to only count down during genuine silence (no inference running, no act executing, no approval pending). No more stale pings during long operations.
- **Oneline multi-task** — `&&`-separated tasks in a single oneline prompt now share one session and one context, instead of spawning separate sessions per task.
- **`list` / `search` tools** — smarter path-vs-type token detection, consistent format keywords across both tools.
- **System prompt** — now lists supported media platforms explicitly so VADAR doesn't waste time on unsupported sites (e.g., Spotify). Top-languages detection improved to surface system + keyboard languages.

### Updated — documentation

- `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md`, `docs/Guide.md`, `docs/READ.md`, `docs/voder-skill.md` updated with: new `quest download image` command, new `results/` directory layout, Reddit + `public_net` platform notes, gallery-dl dependency, cookies retry behavior, `search_media` list-file output.

- **A new warrior in the world of hearable electromagnetic waves — VADAR + the VODER brotherhood**

### VADAR — a new warrior in the world of hearable electromagnetic waves

VADAR is the VODER agent. It is an AI assistant built inside the VODER project, powered by a local multimodal model (Gemma 4 12B, abliterated uncensored variant). VADAR can understand natural-language requests, decide which VODER commands to run, execute them, evaluate the results, and report back to the user. It is available in both oneline and interactive CLI modes.

VADAR has no network access and no system shell access. It can only access paths the user provides and paths inside the VODER project directory. It works with audio, image, video, and text inputs — matching VODER's multimodal nature.

### The VODER brotherhood — agents, helpers, chatters, and more

VADAR is part of a brotherhood — a set of cooperating agents that share context and work together:

- **VADAR**: the main agent. It thinks, decides, replies, and acts. It runs VODER commands, uses tools to inspect inputs and outputs, and communicates with the user in natural language.
- **Eval**: VADAR's brother who evaluates plans and results. Eval has its own system prompt and its own inference call. Eval checks whether VADAR's plan is correct before execution, and checks whether the act succeeded after execution.
- **Summarizer**: VADAR's brother who condenses long outputs into summaries VADAR can work with, keeping the context window manageable. Summarizer has its own system prompt and its own inference call.
- **Catcher**: VADAR's silent brother who validates and fixes tool calls before they execute. Catcher has its own system prompt and its own inference call — it is a real brother, not a script. It knows every tool's syntax exactly and rewrites broken calls so they execute. Catcher is out of context: its reasoning never enters VADAR's conversation, only the engine sees its verdict. When a tool call is invalid, the engine asks VADAR to retry (up to `catcher_max_retries` times, default 3).

All four share the same session context (except Catcher, who is silent and does not enter the context).

### Added — `quest mix` side-quest (audio overlay at specified times)

- **`quest mix "<base>" [<seconds> "<input>"]...`** — overlays multiple audio/video sources at specified start times into a single WAV. The first source is the base (starts at 0s). Subsequent sources can have an optional start time in seconds before them. Audio is extracted from video files. Supports local paths and URLs.
- **Syntax**: `quest mix "song.wav" 20 "vocals.wav" 32 "beat.wav"` — `song.wav` starts at 0s, `vocals.wav` at 20s, `beat.wav` at 32s. Sources without a number start at 0s. Non-numbers between sources produce an error. The first source must not have a number before it.
- **Implementation**: uses ffmpeg's `adelay` + `amix` filters. Each source is normalized to 44100 Hz stereo PCM first. The output duration is the maximum end time of any source. Registered in the Audio Editing subcategory alongside `merge`, `cut`, `remove`, `reverse`, `silence`.

### Added — VADAR oneline mode

- **`python voder.py vadar "<natural-language request>"`** — VADAR takes a free-text prompt, thinks about what the user wants, decides which VODER commands to run, replies with its plan, acts (runs the commands), evaluates the results, and reports back.
- The agent loop: **think → decide → reply → act → eval → reply**. VADAR can loop through this multiple times for complex tasks. Each step is streamed to the terminal.
- **EOS tokens**: `<EOS_REPLY>` signals the end of a reply (user can respond). `<EOS_ACT>` signals that an act command should be executed. `<EOS_DONE>` signals the task is complete.
- **Model**: uses `Gemma4UnifiedForConditionalGeneration` (Gemma 4 12B, multimodal — text + image + audio + video). The model files go in `src/models/checkpoints/vadar/`. The model is loaded via `AutoModelForMultimodalLM` + `AutoProcessor` from the `transformers` library. The abliterated uncensored variant (`OpenYourMind/gemma-4-12B-it-abliterated-uncensored`) is recommended — it accepts all content naturally without refusal.
- **Generation parameters**: temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95, top_k=64, bfloat16 precision on GPU, float32 on CPU.

### Added — VADAR interactive CLI mode (option 10)

- **`python voder.py cli`** then choose **10. VADAR** — opens a chat session with VADAR. The user talks naturally; VADAR thinks, plans, asks for approval, executes multi-step tasks using tools, and reports results.
- **Chat mode**: the user can ask questions, make requests, or just talk. VADAR responds conversationally. For tasks that require VODER commands, VADAR plans the approach, shares the plan with the user, gets approval, then executes.
- **Multi-step tasks**: VADAR can break complex tasks into multiple acts. Example: "isolate only the second speaker from this clip, enhance it, then put it back" → VADAR uses SS to extract speakers, SE to enhance, then mix/glue to reassemble.
- **Time-specified pinging**: if the user is silent for longer than the ping interval (default 15 seconds, configurable in `src/voders/vadars/config.json (ping_time field)`), VADAR can be pinged to check in. VADAR decides whether to reply or stay silent.

### Added — VADAR tools

VADAR has the following tools, emitted as structured tool calls in its response:

- **look** `<path|url>`: analyze an image. If a URL is provided, the engine downloads it automatically and feeds the local file to VADAR. Returns a description of what VADAR sees.
- **listen** `<path|url> [HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS]`: analyze audio. URLs auto-download. Without range, returns total length + (if short enough) a description. With range, listens to that segment (TTS narration prepended stating the time range).
- **watch** `<path|url> [HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS]`: analyze video. URLs auto-download. Same rules as listen.
- **read** `<path|act_title> [start-end start-end ...]`: read text or command output. Without ranges, returns total lines + summarization + the LATEST 100 lines (numbered). With one or more line ranges (e.g., `20-30 50-89`), returns those ranges, each line numbered. Each range must have start < end.
- **list** `[types] [path]`: list files. Types: zero or more of `videos`, `images`, `audios`, `texts`, `others`, `all`, `.ext` (space-separated). Bare list returns counts by category. Multiple types allowed: `list videos images path`. Restricted to the VODER project directory.
- **search** `<query> path <path> [formats <fmt1,fmt2,...>]`: search for files containing the query in their name. Format keywords: `videos`, `images`, `audios`, `texts`, `others`, `all`, or `.ext` literal. Restricted to the VODER project directory.
- **memory_read** `<vadar|user> <id>`: read a memory file.
- **memory_write** `<vadar|user> <content>`: create a new memory file.
- **memory_edit** `<vadar|user> <id> <content>`: edit an existing memory file (must exist).
- **memory_delete** `<vadar|user> <id>`: delete a memory file (must have read it first).
- **calculate** `<python code>`: run Python code using supported libraries (currently: `math` only, configurable in `src/voders/vadars/supported_libs.txt`).

### Added — VADAR session management

Each VADAR session (oneline or interactive) creates a folder under `src/voders/vadars/sessions/<timestamp>_<type>/` containing:

- **inputs.txt**: all user inputs, timestamped.
- **outputs.txt**: all VADAR replies, timestamped.
- **acts.txt**: all VODER commands VADAR ran, with titles, commands, results, and success/failure status.
- **log.txt**: the bare conversation log (system + user + assistant + tool messages).
- **context.txt**: the bare context tokens (the raw messages in the sliding window).

### Added — VADAR memory system

VADAR has two memory directories:

- **`src/voders/vadars/memories/vadar/`**: VADAR's own memories — things it learns about itself, its preferences, its rules. Files are `1.txt`, `2.txt`, etc.
- **`src/voders/vadars/memories/user/`**: memories about the user — name, preferences, habits, etc.

Memories take a maximum of 20% of the overall context window. VADAR can read, write, edit, and delete memories using the memory tools.

### Added — VADAR personality system

VADAR's personality is defined by files in `src/voders/vadars/about/`, all written in **"I" perspective** (not "you") — meaning VADAR reads these as things it already believes or feels, not as instructions from the user:

- **personality.md**: VADAR's default personality. Direct, honest, not formal, not censored. Loves audio. Accepts everything naturally. Does not become the thing the user asks for.
- **custom-vadar.md**: user-customizable VADAR personality traits. **Empty by default (0 bytes).** The user writes their own content here — things like "I am supportive and funny" — and VADAR internalizes these as identity, not commands.
- **user.md**: about the user. **Empty by default (0 bytes).** The user writes their own content here — things like "my name is John" or "I love banana" — so VADAR knows who it's talking to. Can also be edited via memory tools.
- **how-to-respond.md**: response style instructions. Length, language, tone, thinking, acting, admitting limits, multi-reply, silence, refusing, personality stability.

### Added — VADAR dynamic system prompt

The system prompt is regenerated for every message and includes:

- **Current timestamp** in `YYYY/MM/DD:HHam/mm:ss` format (e.g., `2026/07/07:05AM:21:32`).
- **Last seen time**: how long ago the user last talked to VADAR, computed from the latest session's `log.txt` modification time. Formatted as "2 months 12 days 3 hours" / "3 hours 32 minutes 23 seconds" / "seconds only" depending on the duration.
- **System environment**: OS, Python version, CPU cores/threads, RAM total/available, GPU name + VRAM, CUDA version (via `psutil` and `torch`).
- **Top 3 languages** (from locale + environment).
- **Constraints**: no network access, no system shell access, can only access VODER project paths and user-provided paths. Knowledge cutoff: approximately mid-2025.
- **Full VODER command catalog** (from `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md`) — VADAR knows every mode, every side-quest, every chain trick.
- **Personality** (from `personality.md` + `custom-vadar.md`).
- **About the user** (from `user.md`).
- **How to respond** (from `how-to-respond.md`).
- **Global context** (from `src/voders/vadars/sessions/context.txt` — summarization of latest sessions).
- **Brotherhood description** (VADAR + Eval + Summarizer + Catcher).
- **Tools list** with usage syntax.
- **Act format** (`act <title> <voder command>`).
- **Agent loop** description (think → decide → reply → act → eval → reply).
- **EOS tokens** (`<EOS_REPLY>`, `<EOS_ACT>`, `<EOS_DONE>`).
- **Ping time** (from `src/voders/vadars/config.json (ping_time field)`).

### Added — VADAR context management (sliding window)

- The context manager uses a **sliding window** with a 95% retention rate. When the context reaches 100% capacity, the oldest 5% of non-system messages are dropped. System messages are never dropped.
- The context is saved to `context.txt` in the session directory after every slide.
- The global context file (`src/voders/vadars/sessions/context.txt`) stores a summarization of the latest 5 sessions, taking approximately 10-15% of the original context. This gives VADAR cross-session memory without consuming too much of the current session's context.

### Added — VADAR model loading

- The model loading / downloading / caching logic lives in **`src/voder.py`** (not in the VADAR package itself), via the functions `vadar_check_model_downloaded()`, `vadar_download_model()`, `vadar_load_model()`, and `vadar_run_inference()`. The model directory is `src/models/checkpoints/vadar/` (the `VADAR_MODEL_DIR` constant in `voder.py`).
- **`python voder.py vadar "hello"`** automatically downloads the model on first run via `vadar_load_model()` in `voder.py`.
- The loader attempts to import `torch` and `transformers`, then loads the model via `AutoModelForMultimodalLM.from_pretrained()` with `bfloat16` dtype on GPU (or `float32` on CPU) and `device_map="auto"`. The processor is loaded via `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained()`.
- If the model is not found (directory doesn't exist or no `.safetensors`/`.bin` files), VADAR prints clear setup instructions (mentioning the automatic download command) and returns gracefully.
- The model is loaded lazily — only when VADAR is first invoked. Subsequent invocations reuse the loaded model.

### Added — VADAR configuration files

- **`src/voders/vadars/config.json (ping_time field)`**: the ping interval in seconds (default: `15`). The user can edit this to change how often VADAR checks in during silence.
- **`src/voders/vadars/supported_libs.txt`**: Python libraries available to the `calculate` tool (default: `math`). The user can add more libraries (one per line). VADAR sees and uses only these libraries.

### Added — VADAR directory structure

The VADAR runtime data lives **inside** the code package at `src/voders/vadars/` — code and runtime data sit side by side:

```
src/voders/vadars/
├── about/                       # Personality files (all in "I" perspective)
│   ├── personality.md          # VADAR's default personality (shipped with content)
│   ├── custom-vadar.md         # User-customizable traits (EMPTY — user fills)
│   ├── user.md                 # About the user (EMPTY — user fills)
│   └── how-to-respond.md       # Response style instructions (shipped with content)
├── memories/                   # VADAR memory system

│   │   └── .gitkeep
│   └── user/                   # Memories about the user
│       └── .gitkeep
├── sessions/                   # Per-session folders
│   ├── .gitkeep
│   ├── context.txt             # Global context (cross-session summarization)
│   └── <timestamp>_<type>/     # Per-session folders (created at runtime)
│       ├── inputs.txt
│       ├── outputs.txt
│       ├── acts.txt
│       ├── log.txt
│       └── context.txt
├── config.json                   # All VADAR config (model, ping_time, context_length, ...)
└── supported_libs.txt          # Python libs for calculate tool (default: math)
```

Notes:

- The empty directories (`memories/vadar/`, `memories/user/`, `sessions/`) ship with `.gitkeep` files so git tracks them.
- `user.md` and `custom-vadar.md` are **0 bytes by default** — the user writes their own content in them. `personality.md` and `how-to-respond.md` ship with content.
- The global context file lives at `sessions/context.txt` (inside the sessions directory), **not** at the package top level.

### Added — VADAR code structure

The VADAR package lives at `src/voders/vadars/`. Note that **model loading / downloading / caching is NOT in the VADAR package** — it lives in `src/voder.py` (see "VADAR model loading" above). The package itself contains only the agent loop, system prompt, context manager, and tools:

```
src/voders/vadars/
├── __init__.py                 # Package init, path constants, directory creation
├── vadar.py                    # Agent loop (oneline + interactive)

### Implementation notes

- No in-code comments, per project convention.
- VADAR uses the `Gemma4UnifiedForConditionalGeneration` architecture (Gemma 4 12B). The model supports text + image + audio + video inputs via special tokens `<boi>`/`<eoi>` (image), `<boa>`/`<eoa>` (audio). The processor is `Gemma4UnifiedProcessor`.
- The abliterated uncensored variant (`OpenYourMind/gemma-4-12B-it-abliterated-uncensored`) is recommended because it accepts all content naturally — VADAR is a local tool and the responsibility layer is on the user.
- The model is 24GB (single `model.safetensors` file). The model downloads automatically on first run via `vadar_load_model()` in `voder.py`.
- `psutil` is already in `requirements.txt` — used for system info in the dynamic system prompt.
- The `calculate` tool uses a restricted Python sandbox: only the libraries listed in `src/voders/vadars/supported_libs.txt` are available, plus a minimal set of builtins (`print`, `range`, `len`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `round`, `sorted`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, `filter`).
- All file-access tools (`list`, `search`, `read`, `look`, `listen`, `watch`) are restricted to the VODER project directory. Paths outside the project are rejected with a clear error message. URLs are allowed for `look`, `listen`, `watch` — the engine downloads them via VODER's own `download_url_audio` / `download_url_video` functions and feeds the local file to the model.
- The `read` tool can read both files and act outputs (by act title). Act titles must be unique within a session. `read` supports multiple line ranges in one call (e.g., `read foo.txt 20-30 50-89`); each range must have start < end. Without ranges, `read` returns total lines + summarization + the latest 100 lines (numbered).
- The `listen` and `watch` tools support `HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS` time ranges. The `read` tool supports `start-end` line ranges.

## 06/27/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Prebuilt chains and chains system upgrades**

This entry consolidates the prebuilt chains subsystem launch and its same-day refinements into a single update. The prebuilt chains subsystem extends the existing `chains` task-layer feature with a persistent file format. Users compose a chain once with `chains build`, then re-run it any time with `chains load` (oneline) or via the interactive CLI's new option 9 (`Prebuilt Chains`). A `chains journey` subcommand produces an RPG-like Markdown report narrating the chain's path, errors, and alternate dimensions. Prebuilt chain files live in `src/chains/VODER_<name>_<timestamp>.chain` and use a custom key:value text format with `---`-separated step blocks. All chains code — the original `ChainPipeline` engine, the `oneline_chains` dispatcher, the prebuilt chain file format, and the build/load/journey handlers — lives in `src/voder.py` (not split out into separate modules). The only new file is `src/voders/interactiveCLI/chains.py`, the interactive CLI module for option 9. Same-day refinements tightened voice-profile advertising to engine-supported positions only, removed the automated-slot override misfeature, added cross-prebuilt name resolution for manual inputs, removed the development plan file, and finally consolidated the chains code into `voder.py` after the initial split-out proved to be a misstep. A final fix to the chains core makes multi-file chain outputs deterministic by using the first file produced. A subsequent same-day addition shipped `chains comment` (a fourth prebuilt-chains subcommand for editing chain-level and per-input comments on an existing `.chain` file post-build, with non-linear index resolution and "failed to resolve" errors) plus an interactive-CLI refinement that surfaces automated-input details (recalled chain, resolved file, resolved command) in a compact `[details]` block under the progress tracker. A latent bug in `_verify_content_syntax` that caused syntax verification to fail on any chain whose `content:` contained an `input` placeholder or a chain-name reference was also fixed in the same pass. A further same-day emergency check closed two linearity gaps: oneline `chains load` now detects cross-prebuilt forward references (a marker value referencing a prebuilt loaded later) upfront with a clear error instead of failing silently at runtime, and the interactive CLI was restructured to interleave gather+execute per prebuilt (fixing a bug where `prior_prebuilt_names` was empty during gathering, making cross-prebuilt reference impossible). The `chains journey` report was rewritten as an RPG-like narrative with per-mode personas (the Voice Weaver, the Scribe, the Separator, etc.), per-step waypoints, per-error "alternate dimension" blocks, a statistics ledger, a multi-chain saga section, and an epilogue. A final same-day addition shipped `chains decompile` and `chains compile` — two subcommands that round-trip a `.chain` file to/from a raw oneline `.txt` file, letting you edit a pipeline as a single oneline command and rebuild it. No in-code comments, per project convention.

### Added — Prebuilt chain file format

- **`.chain` file format** — plain-text custom KV format. Line 1 is the magic header `# VODER_CHAIN v1 <timestamp> <name>` (exactly 5 whitespace-separated tokens; name must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`, no spaces). Subsequent lines form a header block (`title:`, `description:` — both optional, empty values produce warnings but no errors), followed by `---`-separated step blocks. Each step has `chain:` (required, must be unique within the file), `comment:` (optional), `content:` (required — single line, space-separated oneline command). The literal token `input` is the placeholder for manual file inputs. Prior chain names referenced verbatim in `content:` are automated references resolved at runtime via the existing `ChainPipeline.substitute_refs` mechanism.
- **Step classification** — each step is auto-classified by counting `input` placeholders and chain-name references in its content: **manual** (has `input`, no refs), **automated** (only refs, no `input`), **semi-automated** (both), or **error** (neither — produces a warning, not an error, since modes like `sfx` legitimately take no file input).

### Added — `chains build` subcommand

- **`chains build <name> description "<title-desc>" chain <name1> <comment1> <content1> chain <name2> <comment2> <content2> ...`** — creates a new `.chain` file. Performs basic structural validation (name format, description keyword presence, chain block 4-tuple completeness, duplicate name detection) then runs full verification (format, naming, syntax, references). The file is only written if all checks pass. Output: `src/chains/VODER_<name>_<timestamp>.chain` (creates the directory on demand). Prints a summary (number of steps, manual inputs, automated references) and usage hints for `load` / `journey` on success.

### Added — `chains load` subcommand (oneline prebuilt execution)

- **`chains load <name-or-path> [N:"(v1/v2/...)]... [<another-chain> [N:"(...)"]...]...`** — loads and runs one or more prebuilt chain files. Each chain name resolves to the latest matching file by timestamp (or accepts a direct `.chain` path). Markers `N:"(v1/v2/...)"` supply **manual inputs** for chain step `N` in content order — number of values must match the number of `input` placeholders in that step. A marker value can be a file path/URL (used as-is) or the **main name** of a previously-loaded prebuilt chain (resolved to that prebuilt's final output path at runtime via `ChainPipeline.index`). Automated steps (chain-name references in content) are always auto-resolved and never take marker values — automated slots are not overridable, by design (the whole point of a prebuilt chain is ease-of-use; allowing override would break the chain author's contract). Multiple prebuilt chains can be loaded in one command and reference each other by main name.

### Added — `chains journey` subcommand (RPG-like Markdown report)

- **`chains journey <name-or-path> [<another> ...]`** — runs full verification on each chain and writes an RPG-like Markdown journey report to `results/voder_journey_<safe-name>_<timestamp>.md`. The report is structured as a storytelling narrative with per-mode personas, per-step waypoints, per-error alternate-dimension blocks, a statistics ledger, a multi-chain saga section, and an epilogue. See the "Added — `chains journey` RPG-like narration" subsection below for the full structure description. Multi-chain journey is supported — the filename uses the first chain's name.

### Added — Interactive CLI option 9 (Prebuilt Chains)

- **New menu item** — `9. Prebuilt Chains` added to the interactive CLI dispatch table in `src/voders/interactiveCLI/__init__.py`. The new `cli_chains_mode()` function in `src/voders/interactiveCLI/chains.py` provides a guided UX:
  - **List mode** (option 1): numbered list of all `.chain` files in `src/chains/`, sorted newest first. Pick a number, or type `back`.
  - **Name/path mode** (option 2): enter a chain name (resolves to latest by timestamp) or a full file path. Invalid inputs retry with a warning.
  - **Multi-chain selection**: after loading one chain, the user can add more. Selected chains run in order. Each subsequent chain can reference prior prebuilt main names as manual input values; the available prior names are listed before each step's input gathering.
  - **Verification up front**: before asking for any inputs, the runner verifies the `.chain` file. If verification fails, lists all errors and aborts without prompting for inputs.
  - **Per-step input gathering**: for each step, shows the chain name, comment, content, classification (manual/automated/semi-automated), and a per-slot format string that names voice profiles only at eligible positions (via `describe_input_slot`). Manual inputs are gathered one by one with in-time validation (file exists, URL supported, or prior prebuilt chain main name). Automated steps just prompt "Press Enter to continue" — they cannot be overridden.
  - **Progress tracker**: shows `Prebuilt X/Y (name) — Step N/M (step-name) — <type>` plus `Input K/L for step 'name' — overall P/Q (NN%)`.
  - **Execution**: after all inputs are gathered, prints "Press Enter to start execution" and runs each step. On mid-run error, prints `Something went further than expected.` with the error message (max 500 chars) and the chain/step where it failed.
  - **Blend Again / Exit loop**: standard tail loop matching the other interactive modes.

### Added — Engine-level support

- **`src/voder.py`** (consolidated, no in-code comments) — contains the entire chains system: the `ChainPipeline` class (the chains execution engine — splits argv on `/`, parses segments, validates, substitutes prior chain outputs by name, snapshots `results/` + `voices/`, picks the first file produced for multi-output steps, intermediate outputs moved to `temp_chains/`, final chain's output retained in place); `oneline_chains(params)` (dispatcher for `mode == 'chains'` — peels off `build` / `load` / `journey` subcommand keyword, dispatches to the corresponding handler, falls through to `ChainPipeline.execute()` for backward compat with original `chains "name" cmd / "name2" cmd2` invocations); file format constants (`CHAIN_FILE_MAGIC`, `CHAIN_FILE_EXT`, `PREBUILT_CHAINS_DIR` — `PREBUILT_CHAINS_DIR` resolves to `src/chains/`, next to `voder.py`); `build_chain_text()` (serializes a chain spec to the .chain file text); `parse_chain_file()` / `_parse_chain_text()` (deserializes a .chain file to a structured dict); `verify_chain_file()` / `verify_chain_text()` (full verification — format, naming, syntax, references — returns `(ok, errors, warnings)`); `_verify_content_syntax()` (per-step oneline syntax check); `_verify_references()` (forward-reference detection); `classify_chain_step()` (returns type + manual/auto counts); `find_chain_by_name()` (latest by timestamp); `list_chains()` (all .chain files sorted newest first); `resolve_chain_path()` (name-or-path → absolute path); `get_input_formats_for_step()` (returns the format string for a step's mode); `_is_voice_profile_position()` (per-slot voice-profile eligibility); `is_voice_profile_value()` (heuristic for detecting `.tts` / `.ttse` extensions in a supplied value, including after a `:` prefix like `sts:`); `handle_build()` / `handle_load()` / `handle_journey()` (the three subcommand handlers); `_parse_load_args()` (parses the `chains load` argv syntax into sections + markers — markers supply only manual input values, no chain-number override); `_find_manual_slots()` / `_find_auto_slots()` (slot detection helpers); `_resolve_manual_value()` (resolves a marker value to a prior prebuilt's final output path when the value matches a prior prebuilt main name). `ChainPipeline.execute()` calls `parse_and_execute_oneline()` directly (same module — no circular import needed).
- **`src/voders/interactiveCLI/chains.py`** (new, no in-code comments) — the only new file. Contains: `cli_chains_mode()` (interactive entry point); `_select_chain()` / `_select_chain_by_list()` / `_select_chain_by_name()` (chain selection UX); `_select_multiple_chains()` (multi-chain selection loop); `_validate_input_file()` (in-time input validation — accepts files, URLs, and prior prebuilt chain main names; chain numbers are NOT accepted); `_gather_inputs_for_chain()` (per-step input gathering with progress tracker and per-slot format string with voice-profile-eligible tag); `_execute_prebuilt()` (execution orchestrator with 500-char error truncation and "things went further than expected" framing, substitutes prior-prebuilt-name values with their resolved output paths at runtime, registers the just-completed prebuilt's main name in `prior_prebuilt_names` after a successful run). Imports all chains symbols directly from `voder` (not from `voders.prebuilt_chains` or `voders.sidequests`).
- **`src/voder.py` `parse_oneline_args()`** — the `mode == 'chains'` branch now peels off a leading `build` / `load` / `journey` keyword (case-insensitive) into `result['params']['chains_subcmd']` before slurping the rest as `chains_args`.
- **`MODE_INPUT_FORMATS` constant** (in `voder.py` near line 4077) — declarative table mapping each oneline mode to its accepted input formats. Used by the interactive CLI to advertise valid inputs per step. The `tts` entry now reads `audio file / video file / supported platform URL / .tts or .ttse voice profile (only at voice slots or target slots using sts: prefix)`; the `sts` entry no longer mentions voice profiles at all (STS doesn't consume them). Voice profiles are advertised only at engine-supported positions, not wherever audio is valid.
- **`slot_accepts_voice_profile(mode, content_tokens, slot_pos)`** (in `voder.py`) — returns `True` only for `tts` mode slots where the previous token is `voice` or `target` (or the slot is the first token after the mode). Exposes the exact per-slot voice-profile eligibility.
- **`describe_input_slot(mode, content_tokens, slot_pos)`** (in `voder.py`) — returns a per-slot format string that names voice profiles only at eligible positions, with a clarifying note (`voice slot` / `target slot — only when value starts with sts: prefix`).
- **`VOICE_PROFILE_EXTENSIONS` constant** (in `voder.py` near line 4075) — `{'.tts', '.ttse'}`, used alongside `VIDEO_EXTENSIONS` for input validation.
- **Interactive CLI dispatch table** — `src/voders/interactiveCLI/__init__.py` updated: `'9'` → `cli_chains_mode` (imported lazily from `voders.interactiveCLI.chains`). Menu text and validation updated to accept choices 1-9.

### Changed — Voice profiles advertised only at engine-supported positions

- The flat `MODE_INPUT_FORMATS` string previously advertised `.tts` / `.ttse` voice profiles as valid wherever audio is accepted — but the engine only consumes them in TTS mode at `voice` slots and `target` slots (when the value uses the `sts:` prefix). STS, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS, and train modes never consume voice profiles. The flat string is now more accurate, and the new position-aware helpers `slot_accepts_voice_profile` and `describe_input_slot` expose the exact per-slot eligibility.
- The `chains journey` report and the interactive CLI's per-input prompt now mark voice-profile-eligible slots with `**voice-profile eligible**` / `[voice-profile eligible]` next to the slot description.
- This is detection / annotation only — the validator does not error or warn on voice-profile values at non-eligible positions, because the actual value is supplied at load time (not at build time) and could legitimately be a file path that happens to end in `.tts` for unrelated reasons.

### Changed — Automated slots are never overridable

- The original `chains load` design allowed a marker value to be a chain number (digits only) which overrode a manual slot by substituting the output of the referenced prior chain. This was a misfeature — the entire point of a prebuilt chain is ease-of-use, and allowing the user to override what the chain author intended breaks that contract.
- Removed: chain-number-as-marker-value syntax. Markers now supply **only** manual input values (file paths / URLs / prior-prebuilt-chain main names). Attempting to pass a marker for an automated step (which has 0 manual slots) fails with a clear error.
- The interactive CLI's input prompt no longer accepts chain numbers either — only file paths, URLs, or prior prebuilt chain main names.

### Added — Cross-prebuilt name resolution for manual inputs

- When loading multiple prebuilt chains in one `chains load` invocation (or in one interactive CLI session), each subsequent prebuilt can now reference the **main name** of any previously-loaded prebuilt as a manual input value. The runner resolves the name to that prebuilt's final output path at runtime (same `pipeline.index` mechanism used for in-chain chain-name substitution).
- Example: `python voder.py chains load "bombo" 1:(song.wav) 3:(ref.wav) "second_chain" 1:(bombo)` — here `bombo` in `second_chain`'s step 1 marker is the main name of the previously-loaded prebuilt, resolved to bombo's final output path.
- The interactive CLI prints the available prior prebuilt names before each step's input gathering, so the user knows what they can reference.

### Changed — Multi-file chain outputs use the first file produced

- Some oneline modes produce more than one output file per invocation. The most prominent is `ss` (Speakers Separator) without a `target` keyword — it writes one WAV per detected speaker (`voder_ss_<name>_<ts>_speaker1.wav`, `_speaker2.wav`, …). `svs both` produces vocals + instruments. SS with `overdose` produces one file per speaker after the multi-pass TSE refinement.
- When such a mode runs as a step inside a `chains` pipeline, the chains core (`ChainPipeline.execute()` in `src/voder.py`) snapshots `results/` and `voices/` before and after the step, then picks ONE file from the new files to expose as that chain step's output (later chains that reference this step by name receive that one file).
- Previously the picker used `all_new.sort(key=getmtime, reverse=True)` then `all_new[0]` — i.e. the **latest** file by mtime. For multi-speaker SS this was non-deterministic: which speaker's file was kept depended on filesystem write timing rather than the user's intent.
- The picker now sorts ascending by mtime and takes `all_new[0]` — i.e. the **first** file produced. This is deterministic and predictable: the first speaker detected by the diarization order is the one whose file is kept. Extra files are still cleaned up for intermediate chains as before (only the picked file is moved to `temp_chains/`).
- The fix is in the chains core only, so it propagates to every consumer of `ChainPipeline.execute()` — oneline `chains`, prebuilt `chains load`, and the interactive CLI's prebuilt chains mode — without touching any of those callers. Modes that produce a single output file are unaffected.

### Removed — `PREBUILT_CHAINS_PLAN.md`

- The development plan file `PREBUILT_CHAINS_PLAN.md` has been removed from the repository. It was a working artifact used during the initial implementation and is no longer needed now that the subsystem is shipped and refined.

### Changed — Chains code consolidated into `voder.py`

- The initial prebuilt-chains implementation split the chains code across three files: a new `src/voders/prebuilt_chains.py` module (the file format, verifier, build/load/journey handlers), the existing `src/voders/sidequests.py` (which had been polluted with the `ChainPipeline` class and `oneline_chains` dispatcher), and `src/voder.py` (the oneline parser, `MODE_INPUT_FORMATS`, `slot_accepts_voice_profile`, `describe_input_slot`). This split was a misstep — the user-facing design intent was always that the entire chains system (the original `chains` oneline feature AND the prebuilt chains subsystem) lives inside `src/voder.py`, with only the interactive CLI module `src/voders/interactiveCLI/chains.py` split out as a separate file (because it's a new interactive CLI mode).
- The split has been undone: all chains code now lives in `src/voder.py`. Specifically, `src/voders/prebuilt_chains.py` has been deleted (its contents moved into `voder.py`), and `src/voders/sidequests.py` no longer contains `ChainPipeline` or `oneline_chains` (those moved into `voder.py`). `src/voders/sidequests.py` now contains only the side-quest subsystem: `SideQuest` base class, `SIDE_QUESTS` registry, `_register_side_quest()`, `_discover_quests()`, `list_available_quests()`, and `oneline_quest()`.
- `src/voders/interactiveCLI/chains.py` (the only new file, as intended) now imports all chains symbols directly from `voder` — no more `from voders.prebuilt_chains import ...` and no more `from voders.sidequests import ChainPipeline`.
- The `voder.py` top-level import block previously re-imported `ChainPipeline` and `oneline_chains` from `voders.sidequests`; that line now imports only `SideQuest`, `oneline_quest`, `SIDE_QUESTS`, `_register_side_quest` from `voders.sidequests`. `ChainPipeline` and `oneline_chains` are defined locally in `voder.py`.
- `ChainPipeline.execute()` previously lazy-imported `parse_and_execute_oneline` from `voder` at call time (to avoid a circular import). Now that `ChainPipeline` lives in `voder.py` next to `parse_and_execute_oneline`, the call is direct — no lazy import needed.
- `_verify_content_syntax()` previously lazy-imported `parse_oneline_args` from `voder` with a graceful fallback for test environments without torch. Now that both functions live in the same module, the call is direct (no fallback needed in production; the AST-based test harness extracts and execs the chains block separately for testing without torch).
- The bridge functions `_is_voice_profile_position()` and the helper `describe_input_slot()` (which used to live in `prebuilt_chains.py` and delegate to `voder.slot_accepts_voice_profile` / `voder.describe_input_slot`) have been removed where redundant. `_is_voice_profile_position()` is kept as a thin local helper (it extracts the mode token then calls `slot_accepts_voice_profile`). The two-arg `describe_input_slot(content_tokens, slot_pos)` bridge has been removed; the two callers (`_journey_one_chain` in `voder.py` and `_gather_inputs_for_chain` in `interactiveCLI/chains.py`) now extract the mode token themselves and call the canonical three-arg `describe_input_slot(mode, content_tokens, slot_pos)` directly. The fallback `_FALLBACK_INPUT_FORMATS` constant has been removed (it was only used by the now-removed fallback path in `get_input_formats_for_step`).
- Prebuilt chain files still live at `src/chains/VODER_<name>_<timestamp>.chain` — the `PREBUILT_CHAINS_DIR` constant now resolves to `os.path.join(_src_dir, "chains")` where `_src_dir` is `voder.py`'s own directory (`src/`), so the `chains/` folder sits next to `voder.py` inside `src/` as intended.

### Added — `chains comment` subcommand (post-build comment editing)

- **`chains comment`** is a fourth prebuilt-chains subcommand (joining `build` / `load` / `journey`). It rewrites an existing `.chain` file in place to add or update step-level `comment:` text and per-input-slot `comment.input.N:` annotations. This is the only way to attach per-input descriptions to a chain — `chains build` only takes a single per-step comment, so the workflow is: build the chain first, then document it with `chains comment`.
- **Syntax**: `chains comment <chain-name-or-path> [N:"<new chain comment>"]... [N:(I1:<input comment>/I2:<input comment>/...)]...` where `N` is the 1-indexed step number, `I` is the 1-indexed input slot position within that step (in the order `input` placeholders appear in `content:`), and the `/` separates input entries inside the parenthesized block.
- **Two distinct edit shapes**: `N:"<text>"` (quoted string after the colon) edits the step-level comment; `N:(I1:<text>/I2:<text>/...)` (parenthesized block) edits per-input comments. Both shapes can appear in the same command, and the same step `N` can receive both kinds of edits at once.
- **Non-linear index resolution**: chain numbers and input numbers do not need to be sorted. The user can write `7` then `4` then `3` for chains, and `8` / `19` / `3` / `2` for inputs within a single block. Only mentioned slots are touched — unmentioned steps keep their existing comment, unmentioned input slots keep their existing input comment. This lets the developer document a chain piecemeal without re-specifying every comment every time.
- **"failed to resolve" errors**: invalid chain numbers (`9` on a 3-step chain) and invalid input numbers (`4` on a 1-input step) fail immediately with `failed to resolve '<value>' <context> — chain has <N> <kind>(s). Likely meant: <list>.` The file is **not** modified when any resolution fails. The same single-source-of-truth helper (`_resolve_linear_index`) is used for both chain-index and input-index resolution, so error messages are consistent. `handle_load()` was also refactored to use this helper for its marker step-number validation, so `chains load` now produces the same "failed to resolve" error shape for out-of-range marker step numbers (previously it gave a less helpful "step N has 0 manual input slots but marker provides K values" error after the fact).
- **Empty values clear**: `N:""` clears the step-level comment; `N:(I:)` clears input slot `I`'s comment.
- **Round-trip safe**: the file is parsed, the edits are applied to the parsed structure, then re-serialized via `build_chain_text()` and re-verified via `verify_chain_text()`. If verification fails on the rewritten text, the file is **not** saved and all errors are printed. Existing comments, content, and structure are preserved verbatim for any step or input slot that was not mentioned in the edit command.
- **Implementation**: `_parse_comment_args()` parses the argv into `chain_comment_edits` (dict step_num → new comment) and `input_comment_edits` (dict step_num → dict input_idx → comment). `handle_comment()` resolves the chain path, parses the file, validates every chain and input index via `_resolve_linear_index()`, applies the edits, re-serializes, re-verifies, and writes. `_resolve_linear_index(user_value, total, kind, context_label)` returns `(zero_based_index, None)` on success or `(None, error_message)` on failure, with the error message using the "failed to resolve" phrasing and listing the valid 1-indexed positions capped at 10 entries.
- **`parse_oneline_args()`** for `mode == 'chains'` now recognizes `'comment'` as a fourth subcommand keyword (alongside `build` / `load` / `journey`), stored in `result['params']['chains_subcmd']`. `oneline_chains()` dispatches `subcmd == 'comment'` to `handle_comment()`.
- The `show_oneline_usage()` examples block was not extended for `chains comment` (the chains section there only shows the original oneline `chains "name" cmd / "name2" cmd2` form); the full `chains comment` syntax and examples live in `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md`.

### Added — Per-input comments in the `.chain` file format

- The `.chain` file format now supports an optional `comment.input.N:` line per step block, where `N` is the 1-indexed position of the `input` placeholder in the step's `content:`. Multiple `comment.input.N:` lines can appear in a single step block (one per input slot). They are emitted after `content:` by `build_chain_text()` and parsed by `_parse_chain_text()` into `step["input_comments"]` (a dict `{int: str}`). Existing `.chain` files without `comment.input.N:` lines parse fine — the dict is just empty.
- The parser rejects unknown step keys, so a typo like `comment.input.X:` where `X` is not a positive integer produces a format error at parse time. The serializer writes `comment.input.N:` lines in sorted numeric order.
- Per-input comments surface in three places: the `chains journey` Markdown report (under each manual input slot), the interactive CLI option 9 input prompt (as `Input note:` under the `Accepted:` line), and the `.chain` file itself.

### Changed — Interactive CLI automated-input details block

- The interactive CLI's per-step input gathering (`_gather_inputs_for_chain` in `src/voders/interactiveCLI/chains.py`) was restructured so that automated and semi-automated steps show a compact summary line plus a techy-details block underneath, instead of the previous single-line "This step is fully automated. It uses output(s) from: ..." message.
- **For automated steps**: the simple-user view is now `→ Automated input — press Enter to continue` (one line). Underneath, a `[details]` block lists, for each chain-name reference in the step's `content:`: `recalls:` (the prior chain name and which step produced it, e.g. `'vocals' (output of step 1 'vocals')`), `file:` (the resolved output path from `pipeline.index`, or `(will resolve at runtime)` if the chain hasn't run yet — which is the case for in-chain references during input gathering of the first prebuilt), and `command:` (the chain command with chain-name references substituted by their resolved paths, or `<pending:name>` placeholders if not yet resolved, and `<manual input>` for `input` tokens). The user then presses Enter.
- **For semi-automated steps**: the same `[details]` block appears above the manual-input prompts, so the user sees what's auto-resolved before being asked for the manual inputs.
- **For steps with no external inputs** (e.g. `sfx sound boom duration 5`): the simple-user view is `→ No external inputs — press Enter to continue` (no details block).
- **Positioning**: the `[details]` block is indented two spaces and appears below the progress tracker separator, so it doesn't pollute the simple-user view. A user who only cares about pressing Enter sees the one-line summary; a user who wants to know what's being recalled can read the details block.
- **Implementation**: a new `_format_automated_details(parsed, step_idx, c, pipeline, prior_prebuilt_names)` helper in `chains.py` builds the details lines. It iterates over the step's `content_tokens`, identifies chain-name references (both in-chain prior names and prior-prebuilt names), and for each one resolves the file path and constructs the substituted command. The same helper is called for both automated and semi-automated steps.

### Fixed — `_verify_content_syntax` now substitutes `input` and chain-name tokens before parsing

- A latent bug in `_verify_content_syntax()` (used by `verify_chain_text()` / `verify_chain_file()`, which run during `chains build`, `chains load`, `chains journey`, `chains comment`, and the interactive CLI's verification step) caused syntax verification to fail on any chain whose `content:` contained the literal token `input` or a chain-name reference. The oneline parsers for `svs`, `stt`, `se`, `ss`, `train`, etc. call `os.path.exists(arg)` on positional arguments, and `input` (the placeholder for manual file inputs) and chain-name references (which are also placeholders, resolved at runtime by `ChainPipeline.substitute_refs`) don't exist on disk — so the parsers rejected them with "Invalid argument: input" or "File not found: vocals". This means `chains build` would fail for any chain that actually used the `input` placeholder, which is exactly the chains that need per-input comments.
- **Fix**: `_verify_content_syntax()` now creates a single temporary file via `tempfile.mkstemp()` and substitutes every `input` token and every chain-name reference token in the step's `content_tokens` with that temp file's path before calling `parse_oneline_args()`. The temp file is cleaned up in a `finally` block. If the parser produces an error, the temp file path is replaced back with `input` in the error message so the user sees the original token, not the temp path. The function signature changed from `_verify_content_syntax(step_idx, chain_step)` to `_verify_content_syntax(step_idx, chain_step, all_chain_names=None)` so it can identify chain-name references; the caller in `verify_chain_text()` was updated to pass `chain_names`. The `all_chain_names` parameter is optional (defaults to `None`) so any external caller that doesn't pass it still works (only `input` tokens get substituted in that case, which is the most common scenario).
- This fix was found while implementing `chains comment` (which calls `verify_chain_text()` after applying edits and would have failed on any chain with `input` placeholders otherwise). It's a same-day fix folded into this entry.

### Fixed — Cross-prebuilt forward reference detection (oneline `chains load`)

- A cross-prebuilt forward reference occurred when a marker value in an earlier prebuilt referenced the main name of a prebuilt loaded LATER in the same `chains load` command. Example: `chains load "second" 1:(first) "first" 1:(song.wav)` — prebuilt "second" is loaded first, and its step 1 marker value "first" references prebuilt "first" which hasn't run yet. The previous code path (`_resolve_manual_value`) checked if the value was in `prior_prebuilt_names` (which was empty when processing the first section), returned `None`, and the value was used as-is as a literal file path — failing silently at runtime with "File not found: first" instead of a clear upfront error.
- **Fix**: `handle_load()` now pre-resolves all sections upfront (collecting every prebuilt's main name in load order into `all_prebuilt_names_in_order`) before processing any section. For each section, it computes `later_prebuilt_names` — the set of prebuilt names that come at or after the current position. When processing a marker value, if the value is in `later_prebuilt_names` but NOT in `prior_prebuilt_names`, the command fails immediately with: `Error: step N '<name>' marker value '<value>' is a forward reference — prebuilt '<value>' is loaded later in this command (position P) but hasn't run yet. Reorder: load '<value>' before '<name>', or provide a file path/URL instead.` The file is NOT executed. This makes the failure mode explicit and actionable instead of a silent runtime crash.
- Prebuilts execute strictly in load order — this is by design (linearity). The fix enforces this at the marker-value level, not just at the section-order level.

### Fixed — Interactive CLI cross-prebuilt reference (linearity + prior_prebuilt_names bug)

- The interactive CLI's `cli_chains_mode()` previously had a two-phase design: it gathered ALL inputs for ALL selected prebuilts FIRST (storing them in `all_gathered`), THEN executed them in a second loop. During the gathering phase, `prior_prebuilt_names` was EMPTY because `_execute_prebuilt()` (which adds the prebuilt's name to `prior_prebuilt_names` after successful execution) hadn't run yet. This meant the user could NOT reference any prior prebuilt's output by name during input gathering — `_validate_input_file()` rejected the value with "Not a file, supported URL, or prior prebuilt chain name" because `prior_prebuilt_names` was empty. The CHANGELOG claimed cross-prebuilt reference worked in the interactive CLI, but it didn't.
- **Fix**: `cli_chains_mode()` now interleaves gathering and execution per prebuilt. For each selected prebuilt: verify → gather inputs → execute → (the prebuilt's name is added to `prior_prebuilt_names`) → move to the next prebuilt. This means when gathering inputs for prebuilt N+1, prebuilt N has already been executed, so `prior_prebuilt_names` contains prebuilt N's name and `pipeline.index` has its final output. Cross-prebuilt reference now works in the interactive CLI exactly as it does in the oneline path.
- The `all_gathered` list and the separate execution loop have been removed. The final-output lookup at the end now re-parses the last selected path (since `all_gathered` no longer exists).
- This matches the user's "linear" requirement: load chain 1 → do its inputs → execute it → load chain 2 → do its inputs → execute it → etc. Both the oneline path and the interactive CLI now follow this strict linear order.

### Added — `chains journey` alternate dimension + multi-chain saga

- The `chains journey` Markdown report includes an **"alternate dimension"** block after each step error, describing what the step would do if the error were corrected. For forward-reference errors: "if the referenced step(s) were placed before this step: step N 'name' would need to be placed before this step, the automated reference would have resolved to that step's output file at runtime, and the path would have continued unbroken." For syntax errors with an invalid mode: "if the mode had been a recognized one (tts, sts, ttm, stt, se, sfx, svs, ss, train, or quest), the artisan would have taken the stage and the step would have executed that mode's pipeline." For syntax errors with a valid mode but bad arguments: "if the oneline syntax had been correct, the artisan would have executed as a `<mode>` command with the provided arguments, and the step would have produced its output for the next waypoint." This gives the reader a concrete picture of the corrected journey, not just the error.
- **Implementation**: a new `_what_if_dimension(step_idx, chain_step, all_chain_names, step_errors)` helper in `voder.py` inspects the error categories (reference, syntax, naming, format) and the step's mode token to produce the what-if text. Returns `None` if there are no errors or the error category doesn't have a what-if description, in which case the block is omitted.
- When journeying 2+ chains, the report includes a **"The Saga: How the Chapters Connect"** section showing the load order, each prebuilt's step count and manual input count, which prior prebuilt names are available for cross-prebuilt reference at each position, and the linearity rule: "chapters execute strictly in order. A chapter cannot echo from a later chapter — that chapter's output does not exist yet at this point in the story. If you need chapter B's output in chapter A, tell chapter B's story first." This helps users plan multi-prebuilt sessions and understand why forward references are rejected.
- **Implementation**: a new `_journey_saga(chain_results)` helper in `voder.py` builds the section. It's called from `handle_journey()` only when `len(chain_results) > 1`, and appears between the per-chain detail sections and the Ledger.

### Added — `chains journey` RPG-like narration

- The `chains journey` subcommand produces an RPG-like narrative report written to `results/voder_journey_<safe-name>_<timestamp>.md`. The report is structured as a storytelling journey, not a dry technical analysis.
- **Opening narrative**: the report opens with a storytelling intro that adapts to single-chain vs multi-chain and pass vs fail: "In a world full of complexity and many of the unknowns, someone decided to build a chain called **name** to make their path easier. But did they? We shall find out." The timestamp is rendered in human-readable form ("The journey began on June 28, 2026 at 14:35:50.").
- **Per-chain chapter structure**: each chain is rendered as a "Chapter" (multi-chain) or "Act" (single-chain) titled "The Chain of **name**". The chapter opens with "The journey of chain **name** began on <human-readable date>, when it was first forged." followed by metadata: Scroll (file path), Forged (date), Title, Purpose (description), Steps, Offerings required (manual inputs), Echoes from prior steps (automated references).
- **Waypoints summary table**: the step overview table with columns: name, type, manual, auto, input comments, step comment.
- **The Path Walked**: each step is a "Waypoint" with:
  - The step's intent (comment, or "none written — the traveler must infer the purpose")
  - **The artisan** — a per-mode persona with a descriptive verb. A new `_MODE_PERSONA` dict maps each of the 10 valid oneline modes + `chains` to a persona name and verb: `tts` = "the Voice Weaver" (weaves spoken words from text, designing or cloning the speaker's voice), `sts` = "the Shape Shifter" (transforms one voice into another), `ttm` = "the Song Smith" (forging music from lyrics and style), `stt` = "the Scribe" (transcribes speech to text), `se` = "the Restorer" (cleanses noise, dereverberates, restores clarity), `sfx` = "the Sound Conjurer" (conjures sound effects from text), `svs` = "the Separator" (isolates vocals from music), `ss` = "the Crowd Sorter" (extracts individual speakers), `train` = "the Voice Keeper" (trains and saves voice clones), `quest` = "the Errand Runner" (lightweight utility tasks), `chains` = "the Chain Master" (orchestrates pipelines). Unrecognized modes get "the Unknown Artisan" with "the engine does not recognize this mode".
  - Content (raw and resolved)
  - **Classification narrative** — a new `_CLASSIFICATION_NARRATIVE` dict maps each classification type to a storytelling line: manual = "The traveler must provide N offering(s) to proceed — without them, this step cannot begin.", automated = "This step requires no offerings from the traveler; it draws entirely from what came before.", semi-automated = "This step blends fate and choice — N offering(s) from the traveler, plus the fruits of prior steps.", error = "This step stands at a crossroads with no clear path — neither offerings nor prior outputs guide it."
  - **Offerings awaited** — per-slot format, voice-profile-eligible marker, per-input guidance from `comment.input.N`
  - **Alternate dimension** block (when the step has errors): "But the step falters. Errors are found:" → error list with fixes → "In another dimension — where the chain took another path, a valid path — what could have happened if the error were the correct thing?" → per-error-category what-if description using `_what_if_dimension()`.
- **The Saga: How the Chapters Connect** (when 2+ chains): shows the load order as a numbered list with chapter names, step counts, offering counts, and which prior chapter names are available for cross-chapter reference at each position. The linearity rule is restated in RPG terms: "chapters execute strictly in order. A chapter cannot echo from a later chapter — that chapter's output does not exist yet at this point in the story. If you need chapter B's output in chapter A, tell chapter B's story first."
- **The Ledger of the Journey**: a statistics table with RPG-flavored row names — Chapters (prebuilt chains), Waypoints (steps), Offerings awaited (manual inputs), Echoes from prior steps (automated references), Errors found, Whispers (warnings). Plus an **Artisans summoned** table showing the per-mode persona name and step count for every mode used across all chains. When there are errors, an **All Errors** table (chapter, waypoint, category, message, fix) is included.
- **Epilogue**: the final verdict — success: "The journey of this chain is whole. No errors were found. The path is clear — the traveler may now walk it with `chains load`." / failure: "The journey falters at N point(s). The errors above must be mended before this chain can be walked. Tend to them, and the path will open." Ends with "*The journey ends here. For now.*"
- **Broken scroll handling**: when a chain file cannot be parsed at all, the chapter is titled "The Broken Scroll" with "The scroll at `<path>` could not be read. Its runes are too corrupted to parse." followed by the error list.
- **Implementation**: new helpers — `_journey_report()` (top-level orchestrator), `_journey_opening()` (opening narrative), `_journey_one_chain()` (per-chain chapter), `_journey_alternate_dimension()` (per-error alternate dimension block), `_what_if_dimension()` (per-error-category what-if text with persona flavor), `_journey_saga()` (multi-chain saga), `_journey_statistics()` (the ledger), `_journey_epilogue()` (final verdict), `_mode_persona()` (persona lookup), `_human_readable_timestamp()` (date formatting).
- The `handle_build()` output line reads "Journey it with: python voder.py chains journey".
- `parse_oneline_args()` for `mode == 'chains'` recognizes `'journey'` as a subcommand keyword (alongside `build`, `load`, `comment`). `oneline_chains()` dispatches `subcmd == 'journey'` to `handle_journey()`.

### Added — `chains decompile` + `chains compile` (round-trip .chain ↔ .txt)

Two new prebuilt-chains subcommands that let you edit a chain as a raw oneline command and then rebuild it as a `.chain` file. The platform is open, so why not even its chains.

- **`chains decompile <chain-name-or-path> [<another> ...]`** — extracts a `.chain` file into a plain-text `.txt` file containing the raw chains oneline command. Output: `results/VODER_chains_<safe-name>_decompiled_<timestamp>.txt`. Multiple chains can be decompiled in one command — each produces its own `.txt` file.
- **`.txt` file format**: the file starts with comment lines (`#`) containing the chain name, source path, decompile timestamp (human-readable), title, description, and step count. Then a single line contains the raw oneline command: `"step1" <oneline command> / "step2" <oneline command> / ...`. Each step is quoted-named, followed by its oneline command. Steps are separated by ` / ` (space slash space) — the same separator the inline `chains` oneline feature uses. The literal token `input` marks a manual file input slot; prior chain names referenced verbatim are automated references.
- **Decompile verification + error commenting**: the source `.chain` file is verified via `verify_chain_file()` before decompiling. If verification passes, the `.txt` contains only the oneline command (plus the header comments). If verification finds errors, the errors are **commented out** at the bottom of the `.txt` file under a `# --- VERIFICATION ERRORS (commented out — fix the source chain to clear these) ---` header, with each error as `# [step N 'name'] category: message` and `#   fix: <fix>`. Warnings are similarly commented out under a `# --- WARNINGS ---` header. The oneline command is **always** written, even for a corrupted chain — so the user can edit the command to fix the errors, then recompile. `handle_decompile()` returns `False` if any decompiled chain had errors (so the user knows to check the commented-out sections), `True` if all chains were clean.
- **`chains compile <txt-path> [<another> ...]`** — the inverse of decompile. Reads a `.txt` file produced by decompile (or hand-written in the same format), parses the oneline command, and builds a new `.chain` file. Output: `src/chains/VODER_<name>_<timestamp>.chain` (same location as `chains build`). Multiple `.txt` files can be compiled in one command — each produces its own `.chain` file.
- **Compile parsing**: the compiler reads the `# VODER decompiled chain: <name>` header to get the chain name, `# Title:` and `# Description:` comment lines for metadata (with `(empty)` mapped back to empty string), and the first non-comment line as the oneline command. A new `_split_oneline_segments(command_line)` helper splits the oneline command on ` / ` (space slash space) into segments, respecting quoted strings (so a quoted value containing ` / ` is not split). A new `_compile_txt_to_chain(raw_txt, source_path)` helper orchestrates the parse and returns a structured dict `{name, title, description, steps}` or `None` on parse failure. Each segment's first quoted token is the step name; the rest is the step's content. Step names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` and be unique within the file.
- **Compile verification + no-build-on-error**: the compiled `.chain` text is built via `build_chain_text()` with a fresh timestamp, then verified via `verify_chain_text()` before saving. If verification finds any errors, the errors are printed to the terminal and the `.chain` file is **NOT saved**. This matches `chains build` behavior — a corrupted `.txt` never produces a corrupted `.chain`. `handle_compile()` returns `True` only if all `.txt` files compiled successfully.
- **Comments not preserved**: `chains compile` does not preserve step-level or per-input comments from the source `.chain` (the decompiled `.txt` format doesn't carry them). The compiled `.chain` has empty step comments and no per-input comments. Use `chains comment` after compiling to re-add documentation.
- **Implementation**: `handle_decompile(args)` and `handle_compile(args)` are the two new handlers. `_compile_txt_to_chain(raw_txt, source_path)` and `_split_oneline_segments(command_line)` are the two new helpers. `parse_oneline_args()` for `mode == 'chains'` now recognizes `'decompile'` and `'compile'` as subcommand keywords (the full list is now `build`, `load`, `comment`, `journey`, `decompile`, `compile`). `oneline_chains()` dispatches `subcmd == 'decompile'` to `handle_decompile()` and `subcmd == 'compile'` to `handle_compile()`.
- The architecture made this straightforward: decompile reuses `parse_chain_file()` + `verify_chain_file()` + the existing `content_tokens` field to reconstruct the oneline command; compile reuses `build_chain_text()` + `verify_chain_text()` + `_NAME_RE` to build and validate the new `.chain`. The only new logic is the `.txt` format parser/splitter, which is ~70 lines total.

### Added — SS speaker number parameter (optional, one-file output)

- The SS (Speakers Separator) oneline command now optionally accepts a **speaker number** when used without a `target` keyword (i.e. blind SS mode). The number is placed after the keyword flags and before the input path: `python voder.py ss overdose 3 "input.wav"`. When provided, the speaker number selects which speaker to extract and output as a single file — the pipeline stops after extracting that speaker. When omitted, the previous behavior is preserved: every detected speaker is extracted one by one, producing one file per speaker (`voder_ss_<name>_<ts>_speaker1.wav`, `_speaker2.wav`, …).
- **Syntax**: `ss [overdose] [se] [blend] [video] [<N>] "<path>"` where `<N>` is an optional speaker number. With `target`, the number is not used (target mode already outputs one file).
- **Resolution rules**: `1` = first speaker (by diarization order), `N` = Nth speaker, `999` (or any number higher than the actual count) = last speaker. `0` resolves to `1`. Numbers must be non-negative integers; non-numeric values produce an error. The number is optional for blind SS — omitting it extracts all speakers.
- **Implementation**: `parse_oneline_args()` for `mode == 'ss'` now accepts a pure-numeric argument (`arg.isdigit()`) as the speaker number, stores it in `result['params']['speaker_num']`, and leaves it as `None` when no number is present. `_ss_run_pipeline()` accepts a `speaker_num` parameter; when provided, it extracts only the requested speaker instead of all speakers, producing exactly one output file; when `None`, it runs the all-speakers loop as before.
- The `show_oneline_usage()` examples and mode description have been updated to reflect the optional syntax and to show both the all-speakers and single-speaker invocations.

### Changed — SS overdose uses forced-alignment refinement

- The SS overdose pipeline now uses the same **forced-alignment multi-level extraction** that the TTS dub pipeline's `_extract_speakers_for_subtitles()` uses, instead of relying on VibeVoice ASR re-transcription alone for the multi-pass refinement.
- **How it works**: after the initial TSE extraction (pass 1), the extracted audio is transcribed by VibeVoice ASR to get text, then `_forced_align_words()` produces word-level timestamps. Words that fall within **overlap regions** (computed from the original diarization segments) are filtered out, and the best non-overlapping aligned words are used to cut a refined enrollment clip. A second TSE extraction with this aligned enrollment produces significantly better speaker isolation because the enrollment audio contains only clean, non-overlapping speech precisely aligned to the speaker's actual words.
- **Overlap detection**: for the overdose path, overlap regions are computed by checking all pairs of VibeVoice ASR segments from different speakers for temporal intersection. For the non-overdose path, pyannote's `get_overlap()` is used (same as before).
- If forced alignment or enrollment refinement fails for any reason, the pipeline falls back to the existing multi-pass TSE with VibeVoice re-checking — no regression compared to the previous behavior.
- The non-overdose (pyannote) single-speaker path uses the existing multi-pass TSE with pyannote re-checking, unchanged.
- The all-speakers extraction path (when `speaker_num` is not provided) is reachable from both the oneline CLI and the interactive CLI, and retains the previous behavior for backward compatibility.

### Verification behavior

The same `verify_chain_file()` function is reused across all four contexts (`build`, `load`, `journey`, interactive CLI), ensuring consistent checking:

- **File-level format**: magic line has exactly 5 tokens, timestamp matches `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`, name matches `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`, header block has only `title:` / `description:` keys, at least one step block exists.
- **Per-step format**: each step block has `chain:` (required) and `content:` (required, non-empty). `comment:` optional. No unknown keys.
- **Naming**: chain names match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`, are unique within the file.
- **Syntax**: each step's content's first token is a valid oneline mode (`tts`/`sts`/`ttm`/`stt`/`se`/`sfx`/`svs`/`ss`/`train`/`quest`); `parse_oneline_args()` accepts the full content without error (skipped gracefully if voder.py can't be imported — e.g. in test envs).
- **References**: forward references (a token matching a LATER chain name) are flagged as errors. Self-references are NOT flagged (they pass through harmlessly at runtime since the chain hasn't completed yet).
- **Warnings** (non-fatal): empty title, empty description, empty comment per step, step with no `input` and no references (OK for `sfx`, unusual for `tts`/`sts`/etc.), step with more than 5 manual inputs (suggest splitting).

### Verification

- Smoke-test scripts in `scripts/` cover: position-aware voice-profile detection across all modes; `_parse_load_args` parsing of markers (file values only, no chain numbers); `handle_load` accepting file values and rejecting markers targeting automated steps; `_resolve_manual_value` resolving prior prebuilt names to output paths; plan file removal (verified via `git ls-files --error-unmatch`); journey report marking voice-profile-eligible positions.
- All AST-parse checks pass on the modified Python files.
- No in-code comments added, per project convention.

### Notes

- The prebuilt chains subsystem reuses the existing `ChainPipeline` machinery (now in `src/voder.py`) for the actual step execution and output capture (snapshot-based detection in `results/` + `voices/`, intermediate outputs moved to `temp_chains/`). No new execution path was added — only an orchestration layer on top.
- The `chains` parser change is backward-compatible: existing `chains "name" cmd / "name2" cmd2` invocations continue to work unchanged (no leading `build` / `load` / `journey` keyword → falls through to the original `ChainPipeline.execute()` path).
- Prebuilt chain files are plain text and can be hand-edited, but the verifier will catch most format errors on the next `build` / `load` / `journey` / interactive run.
- The multi-file-output fix in `ChainPipeline.execute()` applies to every chains consumer (oneline `chains`, prebuilt `chains load`, interactive CLI chains mode) because they all route through `ChainPipeline.execute()`. The fix changes the file picked from "latest by mtime" to "first by mtime" — for modes that produce exactly one output file (the common case), behavior is unchanged.

## 06/19/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Chains & Side-Quests: User-Defined Pipelines + the 17-quest Media Manipulation toolkit + side-quest categorization**

The side-quests subsystem as shipped today: 17 side-quests (1 standalone fetch utility + 16 Media Manipulation quests) auto-discovered from `src/voders/quests/`, plus the `chains` task-layer feature for composing user-defined pipelines. The 16 Media Manipulation quests are split into three sub-categories — **Sound Effects** (bassboost, fade, loudnorm, pitch, reverb, soundlevel, speed), **Audio Editing** (cut, merge, remove, reverse, silence), and **Format & File** (compress, convert, glue, noframes). Categorization is defined externally in `src/voders/quests_categories.py` (no per-quest `category = ...` attributes); `python voder.py quest` with no args prints a tree: uncategorized quests first, then each category with its sub-categories nested underneath.

### Added — Side-Quests (17 total)

All quests are auto-discovered from `src/voders/quests/` and appear immediately in `python voder.py quest`. All accept the optional `result "<path>"` keyword. All work inside `chains` pipelines as named steps.

**Fetch utility (standalone, no category):**

- **`quest download "<url>"`** — download a URL from any supported platform (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) as audio (default) and drop it into `results/`. Output naming: `voder_quest_download_<original-name>_<timestamp>.<ext>`.
- **`quest download video "<url>"`** — download the same URL as a full video file (MP4).
- **`quest download "<local-file>"`** — copy a local audio/video file to `results/` with the quest naming scheme (no re-encoding).

**Media Manipulation category (16 quests):**

- **`quest noframes "<local_video>"`** — extract the audio track from a LOCAL video file. Strictly refuses URLs and audio-only files. Output is always WAV (PCM 16-bit 44.1 kHz stereo) extracted via FFmpeg. Output naming: `voder_quest_noframes_<original-name>_<timestamp>.wav`.
- **`quest convert <format> <input>`** — Universal audio format converter supporting 40+ formats including the weird ones (`opus`, `ogg`, `oga`, `gsm`, `tta`, `wv`, `ape`, `mpc`, `caf`, `dsf`, `dff`, `sph`, `sln`, `raw`, `8svx`, `iklax`, `xi`, `sf`, `sf2`, `ircam`, `pvf`, `fap`, `nist`, `nistsphere`, `sox`, `vox`, `amb`, ...). Same-format conversion just copies the file (no re-encoding, no quality loss). Format argument is case-insensitive and accepts a leading dot. Lossy formats are encoded at high bitrates (256–320 kbps for MP3/MP2, 160 kbps for Opus, etc.); lossless formats preserve full bit depth. All outputs normalized to stereo / 48 kHz.
- **`quest compress [1|2|3] <input>`** — Compresses an audio file at three levels. Level 1 = low (mild size reduction, retains quality). Level 2 = default (balanced). Level 3 = highest (smallest file, lowest quality). Lossy formats get lower bitrates (256k → 128k → 64k for MP3). Lossless formats get lower bit-depth / sample-rate (24-bit/44.1k → 16-bit/32k → 16-bit/22.05k for WAV). FLAC also raises its compression level (8 → 10 → 12). The input's existing bit-depth and sample-rate are never upgraded — `compress` only reduces. The console output prints before/after size and percent change.
- **`quest cut <start>-<end> <input>`** — Extracts a time range from a local audio or video file and outputs a WAV (PCM 16-bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo). Time format accepts plain seconds (`20-40`), `mm:ss` (`1:30-2:15`), `hh:mm:ss` (`0:00:00-0:00:05`), and floats (`1.5-3.5`). `start` must be strictly smaller than `end`, both must be non-negative. For video input, only the audio track is extracted (video frames are dropped).
- **`quest remove "<start>-<end>" [...] "<input>"`** — Inverse of `quest cut`: drops the requested time range(s) from a local audio/video file and keeps the rest. Pass any number of `"<start>-<end>"` tokens before the input path — they are parsed, sorted, and merged with a sweep-line algorithm so overlapping or adjacent ranges collapse into a single range (no part is ever cut twice). Examples: `"5-10" "8-15"` → merged to `5-15`; `"0-5" "3-8" "10-15"` → merged to `0-8, 10-15`; out-of-order input is normalized. File duration is read with `ffprobe` so out-of-bounds ranges are clipped to the file length (no errors). The inverse (the segments to keep) is then concatenated with FFmpeg's `concat` filter for sample-accurate joins. Audio input → 24-bit/48k WAV. Video input → MP4 with video re-encoded as H.264 CRF 18 (visually lossless) and audio as AAC 256k; both audio and video tracks are cut in lockstep so they stay in sync. Output naming: `voder_quest_remove_<name>_<ranges>_<timestamp>.{wav,mp4}`. If the merged ranges cover the entire file, the quest refuses with an error.
- **`quest merge <file1> <file2> [<file3> ...]`** — Concatenates two or more local audio files end-to-end into a single WAV. No upper limit on the number of files. Each input is normalized to the same sample-rate / channel layout before being concatenated with FFmpeg's `concat` demuxer for sample-accurate joining. Files of different formats, sample rates, and channel counts can all be merged in the same call.
- **`quest silence <input> [threshold]`** — Strips silent gaps from a local audio/video file and produces a continuous-speech WAV. Uses FFmpeg's `silenceremove` filter: removes any run longer than 0.25s below the threshold (default -50 dB; user-supplied threshold is a positive integer 10–90 meaning -10 dB to -90 dB). After silence removal, `dynaudnorm` applies gentle dynamic-range normalization. Excellent as a chain step before `svs voice` to make rapid-fire continuous speech from a recording with long pauses.
- **`quest reverse <input>`** — Reverses a local audio OR video file. Audio input → reversed WAV via `areverse`. Video input → reversed MP4 with both video frames (`reverse` filter) and audio (`areverse` filter) flipped in lockstep, so the reversed video stays in sync with the reversed audio. Recognized video extensions: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.flv`, `.webm`, `.m4v`, `.3gp`, `.wmv`.
- **`quest fade <input> [seconds]`** — Applies a cinematic fade-in and fade-out (default 5s per side, customizable 0.5–60s). NOT silence-based — the edges rise to ~15% gain (not 0%) using a smooth quarter-sine curve, so the audio is always present and feels like it's *rising* into the mix. A final `volume=1.15` boost gives a slight lift in the body. For files shorter than 2 × fade duration, the fade length is auto-clamped to 25% of file duration per side (min 0.5s). Video input → MP4 with video stream copied, audio replaced with the faded audio.
- **`quest soundlevel <0.01-10.00> <input>`** — Linear sound-level multiplier. **1.00 = original, 0.01 = 1% of original, 0.25 = 25% of original, 1.99 = +99% louder, 2.00 = 2× louder, 10.00 = 10× louder (max).** Decimals (not just integers) are accepted throughout the 0.01–10.00 range, so you can dial in any gain like `1.5`, `0.7`, or `3.33`. Pure linear gain — multiplies every sample by the same factor; affects ALL frequencies equally. No EQ, no compression, no loudness normalization — the simplest possible gain stage. Use it when you just want the audio louder / quieter without changing its tonal character. For tonal shaping use `quest bassboost` (low frequencies) or `quest loudnorm` (perceptual loudness target). Audio input → 24-bit/48k WAV. Video input → MP4 with video copied, audio re-encoded as AAC 256k. Output naming: `voder_quest_soundlevel_x<value>_<name>_<timestamp>.{wav,mp4}` (value tag uses `p` for the decimal point, e.g. `x2p00`, `x0p25`).
- **`quest bassboost <1-100> <audio|video>`** — Professional multi-band bass booster. Scale 1–100 where `1` = subtle warmth (+0.24 dB shelf), `50` = strong club bass (+12 dB shelf, +9 dB peak), `100` = sub-destroyer (+24 dB shelf, +18 dB peak). Selectively boosts low frequencies only (20–250 Hz); mids and highs are left untouched. The 6-stage signal chain (all designed to avoid dotty / buzzy artifacts at any value): 1) `highpass=f=30` removes inaudible sub-30 Hz rumble that would eat headroom; 2) `bass` low-shelf filter at 80 Hz corner with 80 Hz width, gain scales linearly 0→+24 dB; 3) `equalizer=f=50:w=40:t=q` adds a narrow peaking boost at 50 Hz for sub-bass punch, gain scales 0→+18 dB; 4) `virtualbass` synthesizer at 250 Hz cutoff generates sub-bass harmonics audible on small speakers (strength 0.3→3.0); 5) `acompressor` soft-knee compressor (threshold 0.5→0.15, ratio 2:1→5:1, attack 10 ms, release 200 ms, makeup +1.1×, knee 4 dB) glues the bass into the mix and prevents transient peaks from clipping; 6) `alimiter` true-peak limiter at -1 dB (5 ms attack, 50 ms release) as the final safety net. Audio input → 24-bit/48k WAV. Video input → MP4 with video copied, audio re-encoded as AAC 256k.
- **`quest speed <value> <input>`** — Professional time-stretch (Spotify-style slowed / sped-up versions). Values are 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, ... up to 10.00 in 0.25 steps (excluding 1.00 which is a no-op). 0.25 = 4× faster (output is 1/4 the input duration), 10.00 = 10× slower (output is 10× the input duration). Uses FFmpeg's `rubberband` filter with `formant=preserved`, `transients=crisp`, `detector=compound`, `phase=laminar`, `pitchq=quality`, `channels=apart` — pitch and formants stay natural-sounding, like the audio was originally performed at the new tempo. Audio files only (refuses video — use `quest cut` or `quest noframes` first). Output: 24-bit/48k WAV for maximum fidelity.
- **`quest pitch <0.01-10.00> <audio|video|URL>`** — Professional pitch shift using FFmpeg's `rubberband` filter. Range 0.01–10.00 in 0.01 increments (1.00 is excluded as a no-op). Pitch is shifted without changing tempo (the mirror of `quest speed`, which changes tempo without changing pitch). `0.50` = −1 octave (monster / demon voice), `2.00` = +1 octave (baby / chipmunk voice), `0.01` = extreme deep (≈6.64 octaves down), `10.00` = extreme high (≈3.32 octaves up). Uses `formant=shifted` (rubberband's default) — formants move with the pitch, giving the classic tape / vinyl character that makes the demon / baby / slowed+reverb aesthetic actually sound right. For values outside the ±1-octave clean range (0.50–2.00), the shift is automatically decomposed into chained one-octave passes (e.g., `pitch 0.01` becomes 6 passes of 0.5 + 1 pass of 0.64), keeping each rubberband invocation in its clean-operating range. Per-pass config: `formant=shifted`, `transients=crisp`, `detector=compound`, `phase=laminar`, `pitchq=quality`, `channels=apart`. Accepts local audio files, local video files (only audio stream read, video frames dropped), and URLs from any supported platform — YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter (audio downloaded via yt-dlp, temp file cleaned up after). Output: WAV (PCM 24-bit, 48 kHz, stereo). Audio output only.
- **`quest glue "<input-to-use>" "<where-it-will-be-glued>"`** — Mux / replace utility: glues an audio file onto a video file (or vice versa). The video source's frames are combined with the audio source's audio, producing an MP4. Order of arguments only determines which file is the "video source" vs the "audio source" — output is always a video file. **Auto-replaces existing audio:** if the video input already has an audio track, it is dropped and replaced with the audio from the audio input (no `replace` keyword needed). **Duration handling:** output duration is always the *longer* of the two inputs — if audio is shorter than video, audio is padded with silence (`apad=pad_dur=<diff>`) until the last video frame; if video is shorter than audio, video is extended with black frames (`tpad=stop_mode=add:stop_duration=<diff>`) until the audio ends. **Refused combinations:** URLs of any kind (must be local files — use `quest download` first), audio+audio (use `quest merge` instead), video+video (use `quest noframes` on one of them first). Output: MP4 (H.264 video, AAC 256 kbps audio, CRF 20, +faststart). Output naming: `voder_quest_glue_<audio-name>_onto_<video-name>_<timestamp>.mp4`.
- **`quest reverb <1-100> <audio|video|URL>`** — Professional algorithmic reverb on a 1–100 integer scale. `1` = barely-there small room, `25` = chamber, `50` = concert hall, `75` = large hall, `100` = cathedral-drenched. Built in the classic Schroeder topology (the same architecture used by pro studio reverbs before convolution took over). Freeverb is not compiled into this FFmpeg build, so the reverb is constructed from FFmpeg's `aecho` (multi-tap delay) for early reflections AND late-reverb tail, plus `adelay` (pre-delay 5–80 ms scaling with value), `lowpass` (air-absorption damping, cutoff 6–13 kHz scaling with value), `acompressor` (peak control), `dynaudnorm` (dynamic normalization that works at any input level — `loudnorm` with `linear=true` fails on quiet signals), and `alimiter` (true-peak limiter as final safety net). Audio output only — video inputs are accepted but only the audio stream is processed. Accepts local audio files, local video files, and URLs from any supported platform — YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter (audio downloaded via yt-dlp, temp file cleaned up after). Output: WAV (PCM 24-bit, 48 kHz, stereo).
- **`quest loudnorm "<input>"`** — EBU R128 perceptual loudness normalization. Analyzes the file in a first pass to measure integrated loudness (LUFS), true-peak (dBTP), loudness range (LU), and noise threshold; then applies a single linear gain (via `loudnorm` with `linear=true`) that brings the whole signal to **-16 LUFS** with a **-1.5 dBTP** true-peak ceiling. Quiet parts and loud parts end up at the same perceptual medium — ideal for podcasts, voice-overs, and dialogue recorded in different environments. No quality loss, no dynamic-range compression (the relative dynamics inside the file are preserved; only the overall level shifts). Difference from `quest soundlevel`: `soundlevel` applies a user-specified fixed multiplier; `loudnorm` measures the file and computes the multiplier for you, targeting a perceptual standard. Difference from `quest compress`: `compress` reduces the dynamic range *within* a file; `loudnorm` only shifts the whole file up or down as one block. Audio input → 24-bit/48k WAV. Video input → MP4 with video copied, audio re-encoded as AAC 256k. If the input is already at -16 LUFS (within 0.2 LU), the pass-through still runs to apply the true-peak safety limit.

**New chain pattern — slowed+reverb toolkit:** `quest soundlevel` → `quest bassboost` → `quest speed` → `quest pitch` → `quest reverb` → `quest glue` produces a louder, bass-boosted, slowed-down, pitch-down, cathedral-drenched version of a song glued back onto its original music video. All six quests are chain-friendly (each produces a single output file that the next chain can reference by name). Three independent effect axes combine into the classic slowed+reverb aesthetic: `speed` changes tempo, `pitch` changes frequency, `reverb` adds spatial ambience. `soundlevel` and `bassboost` are amplitude / tonal controls layered on top. Finish with `quest loudnorm` if you want broadcast-standard perceptual loudness.

### Added — Chains feature

- **Chains (`chains` feature)** — New `chains` oneline feature that lets the user compose their own pipelines out of voder's existing oneline tasks. This is a **task-layer feature**, not a processing mode — it does not transform audio itself, it composes the main modes (and `train` / `quest`) into user-defined pipelines. Each chain is named, runs a voder oneline command, and its output is captured to a temp directory. Later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths — voder substitutes the chain name with the captured temp file path before running the later chain. The **last** non-empty chain's output is exported to `results/`; all intermediate outputs live in `temp_chains/` so they don't pollute the results folder.
  - Syntax: `voder.py chains "name1" <voder command...> / "name2" <voder command that references "name1"> / ...`
  - ` / ` (space, slash, space) is the chain separator. The slash must be its own argv element.
  - Each chain starts with a name. Names can be anything — numbers, letters, paths, URLs — whatever the user can keep track of. Shell strips quotes from argv, so `"name1"` and `name1` are equivalent as the first argument of a chain.
  - VODER indexes chain names as each chain runs. Before running a later chain, VODER walks that chain's arguments and replaces any argument that exactly matches a previously-defined chain name with the path to that chain's output file. Non-matching arguments are left untouched. Chain name lookups take precedence over file/URL resolution — if a chain name happens to look like a file path or URL, it still wins.
  - Intermediate chain outputs are moved to `temp_chains/voder_chain_<safe-name>_<timestamp>.<ext>`. The last non-empty chain's output stays in `results/` (or `voices/` for `train` chains).
  - For multi-output commands (e.g., `svs both`, `ss`, TTM with stems), only the latest file produced by the chain is exposed as the chain's output. If you need multiple outputs, run separate chains.
  - Validation rules:
    - **Duplicate chain names** (two non-empty chains with the same name) are an error and stop the pipeline immediately.
    - **Empty chains** (a name with no command following it) are **skipped**. Their names are NOT marked as used, so the same name can be reused later in the same `chains` command. This is by design — it lets the user "lay out" a pipeline skeleton with empty chains first, then fill in real commands.
    - **Trailing empty chains** are ignored, just like middle empty chains.
    - If **all** chains are empty, the pipeline returns an error ("no valid chains to execute").
  - The optional trailing `result "<path>"` keyword copies the **final** chain's output to a custom path.
  - The `train` command works inside chains: its `.tts` / `.ttse` file is the chain's output and is stored in `temp_chains/` for intermediate chains. Side-quests (like `quest download`) also work inside chains.
  - Examples: `chains "song" ttm lyrics "la la la" styling "pop" 30 / "voice" svs voice "song" / "cover" sts base "voice" target "ref.wav"`, `chains "audio" quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." / "text" stt "audio" timestamp`, `chains "skip1" / "skip2" / "real" tts script "hi" voice "male"` (empty chains skipped, names reusable).

### Added — Other

- **`quest` with no arguments lists available side-quests** — Running `python voder.py quest` with no further arguments now prints the list of registered side-quests as a tree (uncategorized quests first, then each category with its sub-categories nested underneath), each quest's name and its one-line description, followed by a usage reminder, instead of erroring out with "quest mode requires a quest name". This makes the side-quest system self-documenting — new quests dropped into `src/voders/quests/` are immediately discoverable from the CLI with no extra wiring. The listing is generated dynamically from the live `SIDE_QUESTS` registry and the external `CATEGORIES` table in `src/voders/quests_categories.py`, so it always reflects whatever quests are actually loaded and however they're currently grouped. Existing quest invocations (`quest download "..."`, `quest noframes "..."`, etc.) are unchanged.

- **CLI Default to Help** — Running `python voder.py` with no arguments now prints the help message instead of launching the GUI. Use `python voder.py gui` to launch the GUI as before.

- **`ChainPipeline` class** — New orchestrator class for the `chains` feature. Implements `split_segments()` (splits argv on `/`), `parse_chain_segment()` (extracts `(name, command_args)` from each segment), `validate()` (enforces duplicate-name detection and skips empty chains while keeping their names reusable), `substitute_refs()` (replaces chain-name references with indexed temp file paths), and `execute()` (snapshots `results/` and `voices/` before each chain, runs the chain via `parse_and_execute_oneline`, then captures new files; intermediate chain outputs are moved to `temp_chains/`, the last chain's output stays in place).

- **`SideQuest` base class** — New class hierarchy for side-quests. Each quest subclasses `SideQuest` and implements `parse(args)` (validates arguments and returns `(parsed_dict, error_or_None)`) and `execute(parsed, results_dir, timestamp, result_path=None)` (does the work and returns `True`/`False`). Quests are registered in the global `SIDE_QUESTS` dict via `_register_side_quest(QuestClass)`. The base class exposes only `name` and `description` — categorization is external (see "Side-quest categorization system" below).

- **`oneline_quest()` and `oneline_chains()` dispatchers** — New dispatcher functions wired into `execute_oneline_command()` for the `quest` and `chains` features.

- **`quest` and `chains` added to valid oneline command dispatch** — `validate_oneline_mode()` and `show_oneline_usage()` updated to include the new feature commands with examples. These dispatch as oneline commands but are explicitly **task-layer features**, not main processing modes (the 8 main modes remain TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS).

### Added — Universal URL Architecture

VODER's URL handling has been rebuilt as a single universal platform-agnostic block defined inline at the top of `src/voder.py` (no external module — the entire URL architecture lives in `voder.py` itself, alongside every other core function). The old single-function design — a `is_youtube_url()` that did plain substring matching against three platforms — has been replaced with a per-platform pattern registry, a two-step detection pipeline (URL shape + yt-dlp video verification), and platform-aware download / error reporting. The user no longer has to think about which platform they are pasting from or whether the link is "the right kind of link"; if VODER accepts the URL, the link will actually produce a video.

**Platforms supported (7 total, up from 3):**

- **YouTube** — `youtube.com/watch?v=*`, `youtu.be/*`, `youtube.com/shorts/*`, `youtube.com/embed/*`, `youtube.com/live/*`
- **TikTok** — `tiktok.com/@user/video/*`, `vm.tiktok.com/*`, `vt.tiktok.com/*`
- **Bilibili** — `bilibili.com/video/*`, `b23.tv/*`
- **Snapchat** *(new)* — `snapchat.com/spotlight/*`, `snapchat.com/u/*`, `snapchat.com/t/*`, `snapchat.com/p/*`
- **Instagram** *(new)* — `instagram.com/reel/*`, `instagram.com/reels/*`, `instagram.com/p/*`, `instagram.com/tv/*`, `instagr.am/p/*`
- **Facebook** *(new)* — `facebook.com/watch?v=*`, `facebook.com/<user>/videos/*`, `facebook.com/reel/*`, `fb.watch/*`
- **X / Twitter** *(new)* — `twitter.com/<user>/status/*`, `x.com/<user>/status/*`, `t.co/*`

**Two-step detection pipeline (the new core):**

1. **Shape check (instant, offline, no network call).** Each platform declares its domains, short-link domains (`youtu.be`, `b23.tv`, `vm.tiktok.com`, `fb.watch`, `t.co`, `instagr.am`, etc.), video path patterns, and non-video path patterns. `classify_url()` parses the URL with `urllib.parse.urlparse()`, looks up the host in the domain index, then matches the path against the per-platform pattern lists. The return value is one of `video`, `non_video`, `ambiguous`, or `unsupported`. Non-video URLs — channel pages (`youtube.com/@SomeChannel`), profile pages (`tiktok.com/@user`, `instagram.com/username`), playlists (`youtube.com/playlist?list=...`), explore/discover/search pages, Facebook groups, etc. — are rejected on the spot with a clear platform-named error, before any network call is made.
2. **Video verification (online, via `yt-dlp` with `download=False`).** URLs that pass the shape check (`video` or `ambiguous`) are then resolved through `yt-dlp` to confirm the link actually points to a downloadable video stream. This catches photo posts and slideshows (common on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok), deleted / private videos, region-locked content, and playlist links that slipped past the shape check. `verify_is_video()` inspects the returned `info` dict: if `_type` is `playlist` / `multi_video` / `url`, or if neither `formats` nor a direct `url` is present, the link is rejected. If `yt-dlp` cannot extract a single video, VODER drops the link with a clear error and stops — no half-broken processing.

**Better URL architecture:**

- New inline block at the top of `src/voder.py` (after the imports, before `setup_hf_token()`) — declares `PLATFORMS` (a dict of per-platform `name`, `domains`, `short_domains`, `video_patterns`, `non_video_patterns`), plus public functions `detect_platform()`, `platform_name()`, `is_supported_url()`, `classify_url()`, `verify_is_video()`, `is_video_url()`, `derive_video_id()`, `derive_output_name()`, `download_url_audio()`, `download_url_video()`, and the backward-compatible shims `is_youtube_url()`, `download_youtube_audio()`, `download_youtube_video()` (kept so the 60+ existing call sites in `voder.py` keep working without edits). No external module, no `from url_handler import ...` — everything is in `voder.py` itself.
- `detect_platform(url)` — returns the platform id string (`"youtube"`, `"tiktok"`, `"bilibili"`, `"snapchat"`, `"instagram"`, `"facebook"`, `"twitter"`) or `None`. Used everywhere a platform name needs to be printed in a message (`"Downloading audio from TikTok: ..."`, `"This Instagram link does not point to a video"`, etc.).
- `classify_url(url)` — returns `(category, platform_id)` where category ∈ {`"video"`, `"non_video"`, `"ambiguous"`, `"unsupported"`}. The first step of the two-step pipeline.
- `verify_is_video(url)` — the second step. Runs `yt-dlp` with `extract_info(url, download=False)` and inspects the returned `info` dict to confirm the link points to a real video stream. Returns `(True, info)` on success, `(False, error_msg)` on failure.
- `is_video_url(url, verify=True)` — top-level convenience wrapper that combines both steps: shape check, then (optionally) yt-dlp verification. Returns `(is_video, error_or_None, platform_id)`.
- `derive_video_id(url)` — per-platform ID extraction (YouTube `?v=...` / `youtu.be/...`, TikTok `/video/<id>`, Bilibili BV id, Instagram reel id, Facebook `?v=...` or `fb.watch` slug, Twitter `/status/<id>`, Snapchat `/spotlight/<id>`). Used by `derive_output_name()` to produce stable output filenames like `voder_quest_download_dQw4w9WgXcQ_<timestamp>.mp3` instead of the old approach of mangling the entire URL.
- `download_url_audio()` / `download_url_video()` — drop-in replacements for `download_youtube_audio()` / `download_youtube_video()`. Print the detected platform name (`"Downloading audio from Bilibili: ..."` instead of the old `"Downloading audio from: ..."`). Run the same shape check up front so non-video URLs are rejected before any yt-dlp call. Both also detect playlist responses from yt-dlp and refuse them with a clear error. The `_type` field in the info dict is inspected: `playlist` / `multi_video` / `url` responses are rejected with `"This <platform> link points to a playlist, not a single video"` or `"This <platform> link does not resolve to a playable video"`.
- **Backward-compatible shims** — `is_youtube_url()` is now a thin alias for `is_supported_url()` (returns `True` for any supported platform URL, not just YouTube — the name is kept for the 60+ existing call sites in `voder.py`, quest files, and any external code). `download_youtube_audio()` and `download_youtube_video()` are now thin wrappers around `download_url_audio()` / `download_url_video()`. Nothing breaks; everything that called `is_youtube_url(...)` / `download_youtube_audio(...)` / `download_youtube_video(...)` before still works and now also accepts Snapchat / Instagram / Facebook / X-Twitter URLs.
- **Refactored `voder.py` URL handling** — Removed the old `is_youtube_url()`, `download_youtube_audio()`, `download_youtube_video()` function definitions from `voder.py` (they were ~120 lines of inline code). The new universal URL architecture is defined inline at the top of `voder.py` itself (no external module, no `from url_handler import ...`). `resolve_target_to_audio()` now runs the two-step `is_video_url()` verification (shape + yt-dlp) before calling `download_url_audio(skip_verify=True)`, so non-video links are rejected with a clear platform-named error before any download attempt. `validate_dialogue_source_file()` returns `("url", platform_id)` instead of `("youtube", None)` — the source_type label `"youtube"` was renamed to `"url"` (with the platform id carried alongside) so dialogue source analysis can be triggered for any platform URL, not just YouTube. `analyze_dialogue_source()` was updated to accept `source_type == "url"`, run the same two-step `is_video_url()` verification, call `detect_platform()` + `platform_name()` for the progress message, and use `download_url_audio(skip_verify=True)`.
- **Quest files updated** — `quests/download.py`, `quests/pitch.py`, `quests/reverb.py`, `quests/noframes.py` all import from `voder` directly (`from voder import is_supported_url, download_url_audio, is_video_url, ...`) using local imports inside the function bodies (no circular import — the imports execute at call time, after `voder.py` has finished loading). The `download`, `pitch`, and `reverb` quests now run the two-step `is_video_url(verify=True)` check before downloading, then pass `skip_verify=True` to `download_url_audio()` so the yt-dlp verification isn't done twice. The `download` quest uses `derive_output_name()` to build output filenames from the platform video ID (YouTube video ID, TikTok video ID, Bilibili BV id, Instagram reel id, Facebook video id, Twitter status id, Snapchat spotlight id) instead of the old YouTube-only regex. The `pitch` and `reverb` quests now accept URLs from any supported platform (previously the docstrings said "YouTube / Bilibili / TikTok URLs"). The `noframes` quest refuses URLs from any supported platform (not just YouTube).
- **User-facing messages** — All "YouTube URL" prompts and error messages in `voder.py` are now "supported platform URL" or platform-name-specific. The SS mode banner now lists all seven platforms explicitly. The STT error message `"File not found or invalid YouTube URL"` is now `"File not found or unsupported URL"`.
- **No in-code comments added** — the new inline block in `voder.py` is comment-free, consistent with the rest of the codebase.

### Renamed

- **`quest volume` → `quest soundlevel`** with a new scale. The original `volume` quest (shipped briefly on 06/20 morning) used a 1–1000 integer scale where `100` meant ×2 and `1000` meant ×11 — that read like a percentage but wasn't. Renamed to `soundlevel` and re-scaled to a true linear multiplier: **1.00 = original, 0.01 = 1% of original, 0.25 = 25% of original, 1.99 = +99% louder, 2.00 = 2× louder, 10.00 = 10× louder (max)**. Decimals (not just integers) are accepted throughout the 0.01–10.00 range, so you can dial in any gain like `1.5`, `0.7`, or `3.33`. The behavior is unchanged — pure linear gain, no EQ, no compression, no loudness normalization. Audio input → 24-bit/48k WAV. Video input → MP4 with video copied, audio re-encoded as AAC 256k. Output naming: `voder_quest_soundlevel_x<value>_<name>_<timestamp>.{wav,mp4}` (value tag uses `p` for the decimal point, e.g. `x2p00`, `x0p25`).

### Side-quest categorization system

- **Categorization is external** — Quest files no longer carry a `category` attribute. Grouping is defined in a single dedicated file: `src/voders/quests_categories.py`. That file declares a `CATEGORIES` list where each category is a dict with `name`, optional top-level `quests`, and optional `subcategories` (each a dict with `name` and `quests`). The `SideQuest` base class has lost its `category` attribute entirely; quests are pure behavior (`parse()` / `execute()` / `description`), presentation lives in `quests_categories.py`.
- **Sub-categories** — Categories can contain sub-categories, rendered as a nested tree. Today the only category is **Media Manipulation** with three sub-categories:
  - **Sound Effects** — `bassboost`, `fade`, `loudnorm`, `pitch`, `reverb`, `soundlevel`, `speed` (audio filters that modify sound character).
  - **Audio Editing** — `cut`, `merge`, `remove`, `reverse`, `silence` (timeline / structural operations).
  - **Format & File** — `compress`, `convert`, `glue`, `noframes` (format, bitrate, and container operations).
- **`download` is uncategorized** — It's a fetch utility, not a manipulation, so it's not listed in `quests_categories.py`. Uncategorized quests appear at the top of the listing with no header, then categories with their sub-categories follow.
- **`list_available_quests()` reads `CATEGORIES` at call time** — For each category it walks top-level quests (skipping any name not actually registered in `SIDE_QUESTS` — so a stale entry in `quests_categories.py` doesn't break the listing), then each sub-category. Any quest not referenced by any category is rendered in the uncategorized block at the top. A quest referenced in multiple slots only appears in its first match.
- **Tree output** — `python voder.py quest` (no args) now prints:
  ```
  Available side-quests:

    download    -  Download a URL as audio (default) or video...

  Media Manipulation:
    Sound Effects:
      bassboost   -  ...
      fade        -  ...
      ...
    Audio Editing:
      cut         -  ...
      ...
    Format & File:
      compress    -  ...
      ...

  Usage:  python voder.py quest <name> [args...]
  (Side-quests can be used directly by name — no prefix needed.)
  ```
  Within each indent level, descriptions align by padding quest names to the longest registered name. Different indent levels naturally have different description start columns — the tree shape makes the hierarchy readable at a glance.
- **The category is purely organizational.** Every side-quest is still called by its unique name (`quest <name> ...`) with no prefix — the user does not type `quest "sound effects" bassboost 70 ...`. The dispatch logic in `oneline_quest` is unchanged; only the listing display is grouped. This keeps the command surface flat (one word per quest) while making the registry self-documenting (run `quest` with no args and you immediately see the fetch utility vs. the three Media Manipulation sub-categories).
- **Adding / moving quests is a one-line edit in `quests_categories.py`** — Drop a new quest file into `src/voders/quests/` (auto-discovered, appears in the uncategorized block immediately). When you're ready to file it under a sub-category, add its name to the appropriate `quests` list in `quests_categories.py` — no edits to the quest file itself. To create a brand-new category or sub-category, add a new dict to `CATEGORIES` — `list_available_quests()` picks it up automatically on the next `quest` invocation.

### Changed

- **URL Audio/Video Switch for Oneline Modes** — When a URL from any supported platform (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) is provided as input, the audio vs. video download decision is now user-controlled via the `video` keyword across all relevant oneline modes, instead of being silently decided per-mode.
  - **SE** (`se <url>`, `se voice <url>`, `se sr <url>`, …): URL input now downloads **audio** by default. Add the `video` keyword to download the full video and produce MP4 output (audio extracted from the downloaded video, enhanced, and muxed back into the original frames).
  - **SVS standalone** (`svs <url>`, `svs extract <url>`, `svs only <stem> <url>`): URL input now downloads **audio** by default. Add the `video` keyword to download the full video and mux separated stems back into MP4 (one video per stem, same as local video input).
  - **TTS dub** (`tts dub <url>`): URL input now downloads **audio** by default and produces a WAV output. Add the `video` keyword to download the full video and produce MP4 output with the dubbed audio muxed back in. (Dub already accepts local audio files for audio-only output, so this extends that behavior to URL sources.)
  - Modes where video is **logically required** remain video-only and ignore the keyword: `stt subtitle` (burns subtitles onto frames) and `tts dub subtitle` (subtitles always imply a video frame track).
  - Modes that already honor the `video` keyword are unchanged: `ttm complete`, `ttm bgm`, and `ss`.

### Documentation

- **README.md** — Added Side-Quests and Chains (and Voice Training) to the Features list, the "What Can VODER Do?" section, and the Quick Start examples. Split the "Modes at a Glance" table into a "Main Processing Modes (8)" sub-table (TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS) and a separate "Tasks & Features (not modes)" sub-table for `train`, `quest`, and `chains`, so the docs no longer present these utility/pipeline features as if they were processing modes. Updated the Side-Quests feature bullet and the Side-Quests (`quest`) section to mention the categorization and list the new quests (`remove`, `soundlevel`, `loudnorm`) by name. README remains minimal on side-quest detail (one paragraph + pointer to `docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md`). Updated the "Smart Input Pipeline" feature bullet and section to list all seven supported platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) and mention the two-step verification (URL shape check + yt-dlp video verification). Replaced YouTube-only mentions on the SVS and SLC feature bullets with "supported platform URLs".
- **docs/READ.md** — Replaced the numbered sections "9. Side-Quests (`quest`)" and "10. Chains (`chains`)" with a new umbrella section "Tasks & Features (beyond the 8 modes)" that contains "Voice Training (`train`)", "Side-Quests (`quest`)", and "Chains (`chains`)" as subsections. Updated the intro and Table of Contents so the doc is consistent about VODER having 8 main processing modes plus 3 task-layer features. Updated the "Side-Quests" feature summary to mention the categorization. Renamed the URL bullet in the "Intelligent Source Analysis" section from "YouTube / Bilibili / TikTok URL Support" to "Universal URL Support" and rewrote it to list all seven supported platforms and explain the two-step detection (shape check offline, yt-dlp video verification online).
- **docs/COMMAND_CATALOG.md** — Split the Mode Index table into "8 main processing modes" and "3 task-layer features (not modes)". Updated the Quick Jump table to mark `1a. Voice Training`, `9. quest`, and `10. chains` as features, not modes. Added a "Tasks & Features (beyond the 8 modes)" section break before section 9, and added clarifying blockquote notes to each feature section header. The "Available quests" table now has a **Sub-category** column (Sound Effects / Audio Editing / Format & File / —) instead of the old flat `Category` column, and the table blurb explains the external `quests_categories.py` architecture. Inserted section **9.6 `remove`** (full argument table, overlap-merge algorithm description, examples for single/multi/overlapping/video/mm:ss ranges, refused inputs). Added section **9.11 `soundlevel`** (new 0.01–10.00 multiplier scale, examples for 0.25 / 0.50 / 2.00 / 10.00, refused inputs). Added section **9.17 `loudnorm`** (full argument table, two-pass analysis description, comparisons to `soundlevel` and `compress`, examples). Added sections 9.7–9.10 and 9.12–9.16 for `merge`, `silence`, `reverse`, `fade`, `bassboost`, `speed`, `pitch`, `glue`, `reverb` (each with full argument tables, behavior descriptions, examples, refused inputs). Updated the "Available quests" table to list all 17 quests with their descriptions and output naming patterns. Updated the slowed+reverb chain pattern in the `glue` and `reverb` sections with a 6-chain example: `soundlevel 2.00 → bassboost 70 → speed 2.00 → pitch 0.50 → reverb 85 → glue onto video`. **Input Types table** expanded from 5 rows (Local audio, Local video, YouTube URL, TikTok URL, Bilibili URL) to 9 rows — added Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and X/Twitter rows with their URL patterns; the explanatory note now describes the universal `url_handler.py` and the two-step detection pipeline; the `download` quest section was updated to use `download_url_audio` / `download_url_video` and the multi-platform `<original-name>` derivation.
- **docs/Guide.md** — Moved Side-Quests and Chains out of the "Processing Modes Deep Dive" section into a new top-level "Task-Layer Features (beyond the 8 modes)" section. Added clarifying notes to the Voice Training, Side-Quests, and Chains section headers explaining that they are features, not processing modes. Renamed the "YouTube & Video Platform Support" section to "Video Platform URL Support", expanded the platform table from 3 platforms (YouTube, Bilibili, TikTok) to 7 (added Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter with their full URL-pattern lists), added a new "Two-Step URL Detection" subsection explaining the shape check and the yt-dlp video verification step, replaced the "YouTube Support" column header in the Cross-Mode Integration table with "URL Support", and expanded the Error Handling section to cover non-video URLs (channel pages / profiles / playlists) detected by the shape check and photo/slideshow posts caught by yt-dlp verification. Renamed "YouTube URL Support" subsection under Voice Clip Extraction to "URL Support" with the new two-step flow. Renamed "YouTube Download Tips" to "URL Download Tips" and added a tip about the two-step detection rejecting channel/profile/playlist/photo URLs. Updated the TOC anchors to match.
- **docs/Bots.md** — Split the Mode Options table into "8 main processing modes" and "3 task-layer features (not modes)" sub-tables. Added clarifying blockquote notes to the Voice Training, Side-Quests, and Chains section headers. Updated the Quick Start comment to refer to `chains` as a feature rather than a mode. Added new Workflow 17 (URL → Audio File via Side-Quest) and Workflow 18 (Multi-Step Pipeline via Chains). Updated the side-quests row in the Features table to reflect the sub-category tree and the full quest list. Renamed the "YouTube/Video Download" feature bullet to "URL Download" and updated its description to list all seven platforms and mention the two-step verification. Renamed the "YouTube URL Input" section to "URL Input". Renamed the "YouTube/URL Input" row in the STT feature table to "Platform URL Input". Updated the `yt-dlp` row in the dependencies table to mention all seven platforms. Updated STT, SLC, SVS, and `download` quest descriptions to say "supported platform URLs" / "URLs from any supported platform" instead of "YouTube/URL" or "YouTube, Bilibili, and TikTok URLs". Expanded the STT supported-input-formats list with Snapchat / Instagram / Facebook / X-Twitter lines that share the same verification pipeline.
- **docs/voder-skill.md** — Split the Catalog Navigation table into "8 main processing modes" and "3 task-layer features (not modes)" sub-tables. Added clarifying notes to sections 2.1a (Voice Training), 2.9 (Side-Quests), and 2.10 (Chains) marking them as features. Updated the Overview to introduce the three task-layer features, and updated the closing line from "all 10 modes" to "all 8 main processing modes plus the 3 task-layer features". Updated the side-quests coverage row in the skill table to mention the Media Manipulation sub-categories (Sound Effects / Audio Editing / Format & File) + standalone `download`. Renamed the "YouTube URL Support" subsection to "URL Support" and updated it to list all seven platforms and mention the two-step verification. Updated the Input Types diagram to say "Platform URL" instead of "YouTube/URL". Collapsed the STT input flexibility table (which previously listed YouTube / Bilibili / TikTok as three separate rows) into a single "Platform URL" row covering all seven platforms. Updated the SLC source-input line and the `download` quest inputs-accepted cell to say "URLs from any supported platform" with all seven platforms listed.
- **voder.py print_usage** — Updated the `quest` mode description, the Side-Quests keywords block (now shows the tree: standalone `download` + Media Manipulation → Sound Effects / Audio Editing / Format & File), and the Side-Quest examples block to show the new quests (`remove`, `soundlevel`, `loudnorm`) and the categorization. Updated the SS mode banner to list all seven supported platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter). Updated user-facing prompts ("Enter audio/video file path or YouTube URL" → "Enter audio/video file path or supported platform URL", "Enter the path to your dialogue source (file path or YouTube URL)" → "Enter the path to your dialogue source (file path or supported platform URL)", etc.) and error messages ("File not found or invalid YouTube URL" → "File not found or unsupported URL", "STT mode requires at least one audio/video/image file path or YouTube URL" → "STT mode requires at least one audio/video/image file path or supported platform URL").

### Refactor

- **Modular Project Layout** — VODER's monolithic `src/voder.py` + `src/gui.py` pair has been split into a proper `src/voders/` package so future work can land in smaller, focused files instead of one 16k-line blob. No user-facing syntax or behavior changes — every oneline command, the GUI, and the interactive CLI work exactly as before. The 8 main processing modes (TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS) and the 3 task-layer features (`train`, `quest`, `chains`) all keep their existing command surfaces.
  - New package: `src/voders/` with `__init__.py`, `gui.py`, `cli.py`, `sidequests.py`, and a `quests/` subpackage with `__init__.py` plus one file per quest.
  - `src/voders/gui.py` — moved verbatim from `src/gui.py`. The internal `_src_dir` now resolves to the parent `src/` directory (one level up from `voders/`) so the GUI's `subprocess.Popen([python, voder_path, ...])` calls still point at `src/voder.py`. The GUI is launched the same way: `python voder.py gui`.
  - `src/voders/cli.py` — extracted `print_banner()` and `interactive_cli_mode()` out of `voder.py`. The interactive CLI lazy-imports the per-mode `cli_*_mode()` entry points from `voder` at call time (avoids a circular import between `voder.py` and `voders.cli`). Launched the same way: `python voder.py cli`.
  - `src/voders/sidequests.py` — new home for the entire side-quest + chains subsystem: the `SideQuest` base class (with `name` and `description` attributes and `parse()`/`execute()` methods — no `category` attribute, categorization is external), the `SIDE_QUESTS` registry, the `_register_side_quest()` helper, the `oneline_quest()` dispatcher, the `ChainPipeline` orchestrator class, and the `oneline_chains()` dispatcher. `ChainPipeline.execute()` lazy-imports `parse_and_execute_oneline` from `voder` at call time (same circular-import avoidance). `list_available_quests()` reads the external `CATEGORIES` table from `quests_categories.py` and renders a tree (uncategorized first, then each category with its sub-categories nested underneath).
  - `src/voders/quests_categories.py` — new dedicated file declaring the `CATEGORIES` list. Each category is a dict with `name`, optional top-level `quests`, and optional `subcategories` (each a dict with `name` and `quests`). Today the only category is **Media Manipulation** with three sub-categories: Sound Effects, Audio Editing, Format & File. Quests not listed here (like `download`) appear in the uncategorized block at the top of the listing.
  - `src/voders/quests/` — one file per quest. The file's stem (without `.py`) **is** the quest name used by `voder.py quest <name>`. Each quest file defines a single `Quest` subclass of `SideQuest` with its `name` attribute set to match the filename and `parse()`/`execute()` methods, and self-registers via `_register_side_quest(Quest)` at import time. Quest files carry no categorization — grouping is owned by `quests_categories.py`.
    - `src/voders/quests/download.py` → `quest download` (uncategorized — standalone fetch utility)
    - `src/voders/quests/{bassboost,compress,convert,cut,fade,glue,loudnorm,merge,noframes,pitch,remove,reverb,reverse,silence,soundlevel,speed}.py` → 16 Media Manipulation quests, filed into Sound Effects / Audio Editing / Format & File sub-categories by `quests_categories.py`
  - **Quest auto-discovery** — When `voders.sidequests` is first imported, it scans its own `quests/` directory, imports every `*.py` file (skipping `_`-prefixed dunders), finds the `Quest` class in each, and registers it under its `name` attribute. Adding a new quest is now a single file: drop `src/voders/quests/<new-name>.py`, define `class Quest(SideQuest)` with `name = '<new-name>'` and `parse()`/`execute()` methods, call `_register_side_quest(Quest)` at the bottom of the file — no edits needed anywhere else. The new quest appears in the uncategorized block of `python voder.py quest` immediately; file it under a sub-category later by adding its name to `quests_categories.py`.
  - **`src/voder.py` shrink** — Removed `print_banner()`, `interactive_cli_mode()`, `class SideQuest`, `class DownloadQuest`, `class NoFramesQuest`, `SIDE_QUESTS`, `_register_side_quest()`, `_register_side_quest(DownloadQuest)` / `_register_side_quest(NoFramesQuest)`, `oneline_quest()`, `class ChainPipeline`, and `oneline_chains()` from `voder.py`. The dispatch table in `execute_oneline_command()` still calls `oneline_quest(params)` and `oneline_chains(params)`, but those names are now imported at the top of `voder.py` from `voders.sidequests`. The `__main__` block now lazy-imports `launch` from `voders.gui` (for the `gui` subcommand) and `interactive_cli_mode` from `voders.cli` (for the `cli` subcommand). `parse_and_execute_oneline()` stays in `voder.py` (it's the entry point chains call back into).
  - **Backward-compatible re-exports** — `voder.py` re-exports `SideQuest`, `ChainPipeline`, `oneline_quest`, `oneline_chains`, `SIDE_QUESTS`, and `_register_side_quest` from `voders.sidequests` at module load time, so any external code (or test script) that does `voder.ChainPipeline`, `voder.SIDE_QUESTS`, `voder.oneline_quest`, etc. continues to work without changes. The concrete quest classes (`DownloadQuest`, `NoFramesQuest`) are no longer re-exported — they live at `voders.quests.download.Quest` and `voders.quests.noframes.Quest` and should be imported from there if anything needs them directly.
  - **`src/gui.py` deleted** — Moved to `src/voders/gui.py` (see above). No other files in the project imported `gui` directly; `voder.py`'s `__main__` block was the only caller, and it now uses the new path.
- **Universal URL handler block in `src/voder.py`** — All URL detection, classification, verification, and download logic now lives inline at the top of `src/voder.py` (no external module — kept inside the main file as the user requested, with no in-code comments). Previously this was three inline functions in `voder.py` (`is_youtube_url` doing substring matching, `download_youtube_audio`, `download_youtube_video`) — they have been removed and replaced with the new universal block. The new block exposes `PLATFORMS`, `detect_platform()`, `platform_name()`, `is_supported_url()`, `classify_url()`, `verify_is_video()`, `is_video_url()`, `derive_video_id()`, `derive_output_name()`, `download_url_audio()`, `download_url_video()`, plus the three backward-compatible shims (`is_youtube_url`, `download_youtube_audio`, `download_youtube_video`) so the 60+ existing call sites in `voder.py` and the four quest files (`download.py`, `pitch.py`, `reverb.py`, `noframes.py`) keep working without edits. See the "Added — Universal URL Architecture" section above for the full architecture description.

## 05/29/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Major Integrations and Modernifications**

### Added

#### Fish Audio S2-Pro Integration

- **`extreme` Keyword** — New keyword for TTS mode and its sub-tasks (TTS, SLC, SVC, Modify Speech) that switches the TTS engine from Qwen3-TTS to Fish Audio S2-Pro for higher quality voice cloning and broader language support. Can be used alongside `overdose` (they serve different purposes: overdose = STT/TTM model selection, extreme = TTS model upgrade). Placed after `overdose` in syntax and prompts. Also available for STS mode to pre-process the target voice reference through Fish S2 Pro before Seed-VC conversion, producing a cleaner voice profile that extracts the dominant voice and removes background artifacts/noise.

- **Fish Audio S2-Pro** — New TTS model integrated into VODER. A dual-autoregressive (4B + 400M) model with RVQ-based codec supporting 80+ languages, voice effects via `[tag]` syntax, and superior voice cloning quality.
  - Model: `fishaudio/s2-pro` from HuggingFace, stored at `src/models/checkpoints/fish_s2pro/`
  - Source code: `src/fish_speech/` (stripped from fish-speech repo, inference-only)
  - Auto-downloads on first use
  - S2-Pro well-tested tags: emotions (`[excited]`, `[angry]`, `[sad]`), tones (`[whispering]`, `[soft voice]`, `[low voice]`, `[loud voice]`, `[shouting]`), breathing (`[sigh]`, `[inhale]`, `[exhale]`, `[gasp]`, `[panting]`, `[clears throat]`), vocal sounds (`[laughing]`, `[chuckling]`, `[giggle]`, `[sobbing]`, `[crying]`, `[groan]`), pacing (`[pause]`, `[short pause]`, `[long pause]`), special (`[emphasis]`, `[rustling sound]`), and 15,000+ free-form tags including multi-language
  - 64 S1 Pro tags also work in `[brackets]` (designed for S1 `(parenthesis)` syntax, compatible with S2-Pro): emotions, tone markers, vocal sounds, crowd effects
  - Supports native multi-speaker in one pass using `Name: text` syntax or via `<|speaker:i|>` tokens (noted in Guide but dialogue mode recommended instead)

- **Train Extreme** — `voder.py train extreme voice:name "ref.wav"` trains a voice using Fish S2-Pro and saves it as a `.ttse` file (instead of `.tts`). `.tts` files only work without extreme, `.ttse` files only work with extreme — a clear error message is shown if mismatched.

- **Voice Design with Extreme Mode** — When `extreme` is used with a `voice` prompt (not `target`), VODER always generates ~30s placeholder English text, has VoiceDesign speak it, feeds that audio to Fish for cloning, then Fish speaks the actual text. This applies unconditionally — even for languages VoiceDesign already supports — to ensure consistent voice quality, preserve voice effects tags across all languages, and eliminate the need for language detection. This enables voice design for languages like Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Turkish, and 70+ others that VoiceDesign doesn't natively support, while also improving results for the 10 supported ones.

- **Extreme in SLC** — `tts extreme slc "path.wav"` and `tts overdose extreme slc "path.wav"` use Fish S2-Pro for the resynthesis step. Supports `.ttse` premade voice files.

- **Extreme in SVC** — `tts extreme svc "path.wav" target "ref.wav"` uses Fish S2-Pro for the re-synthesis step. Supports `.ttse` premade voice files.

- **Extreme in Modify Speech** — TTS interactive modify speech now includes an "Enable extreme? (Y/N)" prompt after overdose. When enabled, Fish S2-Pro replaces Qwen3-TTS for voice extraction and synthesis.

- **Extreme in STS** — `sts extreme base "source.wav" target "voice.wav"` pre-processes the target voice reference through Fish S2 Pro before Seed-VC conversion. The compiled target reference is transcribed with VibeVoice ASR, then re-synthesized with Fish S2 Pro to produce a cleaner, more natural voice profile that extracts the dominant voice and removes background artifacts/noise. This gives Seed-VC a cleaner reference input, improving voice conversion quality especially when the reference contains mixed audio or background noise. Works with both Seed-VC v1 (`music` flag) and v2 (standard/mimic). Oneline mode only. If the extreme pass fails, the original target reference is used as fallback.

- **TTM Voice** — `ttm voice` keyword generates a song via ACE-Step then automatically extracts clean vocals via the SVS voice pipe. Output is the isolated vocal track. Supports `target` reference audio and `overdose` quality. Syntax: `voder.py ttm voice lyrics "..." styling "..." 30`

- **TTM Reference Stem Extraction** — Reference and target paths in TTM now support optional stem extraction via ACE-Step XL-Base. Syntax: `stem/(path)` extracts a single stem, `stem-stem/(path)` extracts and mixes multiple stems, `stem/nn-nn(path)` combines stem extraction with time-range cutting. The 12 available stems are: `woodwinds`, `brass`, `fx`, `synth`, `strings`, `percussion`, `keyboard`, `guitar`, `bass`, `drums`, `backing_vocals`, `vocals`. Stem extraction runs after SVS (voice/music) and before time-range cutting. Examples: `reference "drums/(ref.wav)"`, `reference music "bass-drums/30-60(ref.wav)"`, `target voice "keyboard/(ref.wav)"`. Works across all TTM sub-tasks that accept references (remix, repaint, complete, lego, bgm) and the `target` keyword.

#### TranslateGemma 12B Integration

- **TranslateGemma 12B** — New translation model integrated into VODER (`google/translategemma-12b-it`, 12B parameters). Supports true any-to-any translation across 55 languages, replacing Whisper's any-to-English-only translation limitation. Requires 24GB+ VRAM. Stored at `src/models/checkpoints/translategemma/`.

- **`translate (source-target)` Syntax** — New syntax for STT any-to-any translation using TranslateGemma. The bare `translate` flag (without parentheses) still uses Whisper for any-to-English translation (backward compatible). The `translate (source-target)` syntax uses TranslateGemma and supports any target language. `auto` can be used for source language auto-detection. Examples: `translate (auto-ar)` auto-detects source and translates to Arabic; `translate (ja-en)` translates Japanese to English; `translate (auto-en)` auto-detects source and translates to English.

- **STT Subtitle + Translate** — `stt subtitle translate (auto-ar) "video.mp4"` now supports translated subtitles. When `translate (source-target)` is used with `subtitle`, VibeVoice ASR transcribes the speech, TranslateGemma translates the transcript, and the translated subtitles are burned onto the video.

- **STT Overdose + Translate** — `stt overdose translate "(auto-fr)" "audio.wav"` is now supported. Previously, `overdose` and `translate` were mutually exclusive because Whisper could not translate with VibeVoice ASR. TranslateGemma decouples translation from ASR, allowing overdose-quality transcription with any-to-any translation. The bare `translate` (without parentheses) remains incompatible with `overdose` (it uses Whisper's built-in translation which conflicts with VibeVoice ASR).

- **SLC Any-to-Any Translation** — `tts slc translate (auto-ar) "audio.wav"` translates speech to any target language instead of only English. The `translate (source-target)` syntax replaces Whisper's English-only limitation with TranslateGemma's 55-language support. The original SLC behavior (translate to English using Whisper) is preserved when no `translate` syntax is used.

- **TTS Dub Sub-Task** — New `tts dub` sub-task for video/audio dubbing with voice cloning, translation, and speed adjustment. Pipeline: SVS voice isolation → VibeVoice ASR with audio events → speaker detection → TranslateGemma per-segment translation (with timing context) → Fish S2 Pro TTS per segment (voice cloning from source, short segments avoid drift) → per-segment speed adjustment → timeline-based assembly (overlay each segment at its original position) → mix with instrumentals → mux with video. Auto-translates to English by default (no `translate` keyword needed). Supports optional `subtitle` keyword to burn translated subtitles onto the output video. Commands: `tts dub "video.mp4"`, `tts dub subtitle "video.mp4"`, `tts dub translate "(auto-ar)" "video.mp4"`, `tts dub translate "(auto-ar)" subtitle "video.mp4"`, `tts dub "audio.wav"`.

- **Dub Pipeline Architecture** — The dub pipeline chains SVS voice+music separation, VibeVoice ASR with audio events for transcription and non-speech detection, TranslateGemma for any-to-any translation with per-segment timing context, Fish S2 Pro for per-segment TTS with voice cloning from source audio, per-segment audio speed adjustment to match original segment timing, timeline-based assembly using `_overlay_segment_on_base()` for proper temporal positioning, instrumental track mixing for music preservation, and FFmpeg video muxing for video output. VibeVoice ASR, TranslateGemma, and Fish S2 Pro are loaded separately (never simultaneously) to fit within 24GB VRAM. Dub defaults to auto-to-English translation when no `translate` keyword is specified.

- **VibeVoice ASR `transcribe_with_events()`** — New method that preserves audio event tags (`[Silence]`, `[Lyric]`, `[Music]`, `[Noise]`, `[Applause]`, `[Laughter]`, `[Cough]`, `[Breath]`) alongside speech segments. Audio events are tagged with `is_event=True` and `event_type` fields. Used by the dub pipeline to identify non-speech portions that should not be translated or dubbed — these segments are left as silence in the dubbed output. The existing `transcribe()` method continues to filter out audio events for backward compatibility.

- **Audio Timeline Assembly Helpers** — New helper functions for dub pipeline: `_overlay_segment_on_base()` overlays an audio segment at a specific time position using ffmpeg `adelay` + `amix`, and `_extract_audio_segment()` extracts a time range from an audio file.

#### STT Subtitle Sub-Task

- **`subtitle` Keyword** — New STT sub-task keyword that transcribes a video's speech using VibeVoice ASR and burns the subtitles directly onto the video as ASS-format overlays. Implies `overdose` (VibeVoice ASR is always used). Only accepts video files and URLs — audio, text, and image files are rejected.
- **Dynamic Subtitle Positioning** — Subtitles are dynamically scaled and positioned at the bottom of the frame relative to the video resolution. Font size, margins, outline width, and shadow offset are all calculated proportionally to the video height, ensuring consistent appearance from 480p to 4K.
- **Overlap Handling** — When overlapping speech is detected (two speakers talking simultaneously), the primary speaker's text appears on the first line (white), and the overlapping speaker's text appears on a second line beneath it in cyan, making it visually clear that a different speaker is talking.
- **Forced Alignment for Per-Sentence Subtitles** — Subtitles now use Meta's MMS-FA forced alignment model to produce per-word timestamps, grouped into 3-5 word subtitle segments for accurate timing. Previously, subtitles displayed entire ASR segments (often 10+ seconds) at once; now each subtitle line shows a short phrase with precise start/end times. This applies to all subtitle paths: `stt subtitle`, `tts dub subtitle`, and `tts dub subtitle original`. For translated subtitles, the original text is aligned first to get accurate timings, then each chunk is translated while preserving the original timing — producing semi-accurate translated subtitles that sync with the original audio. If forced alignment fails, the system falls back to original ASR segment timings.
- **Full Pipeline** — Download video (if URL) → Extract audio via FFmpeg → SVS voice isolation (BS-RoFormer) → Optional sound enhancement (`se`) → VibeVoice ASR transcription → MMS-FA forced alignment (per-word timestamps grouped into 3-5 word segments) → Burn ASS subtitles onto video via FFmpeg → Output MP4.
- Syntax: `voder.py stt subtitle "video.mp4"`, `voder.py stt subtitle se "noisy_video.mp4"`, `voder.py stt subtitle "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."`

#### SE Sound Enhancement Modernization

- **SE renamed to Sound Enhancement** — "Speech Enhancement" renamed to "Sound Enhancement" across all code and documentation, reflecting the expanded scope beyond just speech.

- **SE Sub-Modes** — SE mode now supports sub-mode keywords for targeted enhancement:
  - `se "path"` — Default UniSE enhancement (denoise, dereverb, restore speech, 16kHz output)
  - `se voice "path"` — SVS voice extraction → UniSE enhancement on vocals only
  - `se voice blend "path"` — SVS voice+music → UniSE on voice → blend enhanced vocals with music at 48kHz
  - `se sr "path"` — AudioSR super-resolution on whole audio (basic model, 48kHz output)
  - `se sr music "path"` — SVS voice+music → AudioSR (basic model) on music → upsampled music only at 48kHz
  - `se sr music blend "path"` — SVS voice+music → AudioSR on music + UniSE on voice → blend at 48kHz
  - `se sr voice "path"` — SVS voice extraction → AudioSR (speech model) on vocals → upsampled vocals at 48kHz
  - `se sr voice blend "path"` — SVS voice+music → AudioSR speech on vocals → blend with music at 48kHz
  - `se sr voice music "path"` — SVS voice+music → AudioSR speech on vocals + AudioSR basic on music → auto-blend at 48kHz

- **AudioSR Integration** — New audio super-resolution model integrated into VODER. Uses `haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution` (AudioSR) for upscaling low-sample-rate audio to 48kHz. Two model variants: `basic` (general audio/music) and `speech` (speech-optimized). Source code: `src/audiosr/` (stripped from versatile_audio_super_resolution repo, inference-only). Model checkpoint: `src/models/checkpoints/audiosr/`. Auto-downloads on first use. Handles long audio via chunked overlap-add processing.

- **`AudioSREnhancer` Class** — New model wrapper class following VODER's standard load/use/cleanup pattern. Supports both `basic` and `speech` model variants. Auto-selects chunked processing for audio >10.24s.

- **`_mix_audio_at_target_sr()` Helper** — New helper function for blending two audio files at a target sample rate. Resamples both inputs to the target rate, converts to mono, pads to equal length, sums with peak normalization. Used by `blend` keyword in SE sub-modes to preserve upsampled quality (never downsamples the upsampled track).

- **SE Parser Update** — SE oneline parser now accepts sub-mode keywords (`voice`, `sr`, `music`, `blend`) with validation rules: `music` only valid after `sr` or `sr voice`, `voice` after `sr` creates `sr_voice` sub-mode, `blend` valid with `voice`, `sr music`, or `sr voice` sub-modes only. Removed invalid `se sr blend` sub-mode (plain `se sr` uses basic model on full input).

#### SS Mode Enhancements

- **SS `blend` Keyword** — New oneline keyword for SS mode that blends each separated speaker's audio with the original non-vocals (instrumental/background) track extracted via SVS. After speaker extraction (and optional SE), each output is mixed with the music/instrumental stem at 48kHz via `_mix_audio_at_target_sr()`. Outputs carry a `_blend` suffix. Works in both target and auto-separation modes, and with `se` and `overdose`. Useful for vlogs or recordings where you want to isolate a speaker while preserving background audio. Examples: `ss blend "vlog.wav"`, `ss target "ref.wav" blend "conversation.wav"`, `ss overdose se blend "noisy_conversation.wav"`.

- **SS `video` Keyword** — New oneline keyword for SS mode that produces video output. When the input is a video file or URL, each separated speaker's audio is muxed with the original video frames via ffmpeg to produce MP4 output (one video per speaker). Ignored when the input is an audio-only file (prints info message and continues). Works in both target and auto-separation modes, and with `se`, `overdose`, and `blend`. Useful for removing unwanted speakers from a video while keeping the visuals — e.g., extracting only your own speech from a vlog recording. Examples: `ss video "interview.mp4"`, `ss target "ref.wav" video "interview.mp4"`, `ss overdose se blend video "vlog.mp4"`.

### Changed

- Interactive TTS mode now prompts for `extreme` after `overdose` (both in the main flow and in modify speech)
- Oneline TTS parser accepts `extreme` keyword after `overdose`
- `_assemble_enhanced_dialogue()` accepts `use_extreme` and `fish_voice_data` parameters for dialogue-level Fish synthesis
- Voice mismatch check (`.tts` vs `.ttse`) applies across all TTS sub-tasks
- Voice design with extreme mode now always uses the placeholder trick unconditionally (generates English placeholder → Fish clones it → Fish speaks actual text), even for languages VoiceDesign already supports. This fixes voice effects tags being misinterpreted by VoiceDesign and ensures consistent quality across all languages
- Extreme mode dialogue with voice-design characters now correctly applies the placeholder trick per character (was previously broken — VoiceDesign was used directly, causing crashes with unsupported languages and voice effects tags)
- Removed dead `_detect_text_language()` function (was defined but never called)
- `ttm voice` keyword now works in standard TTM mode (was previously restricted to complete/lego tasks only)

## 05/21/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Major Update & Bug Hunt Activity**

### Added

#### TTS Voice Training

- **`train voice:character-name` Command** — New oneline command to train Qwen-TTS Base voice clones and save them as `.tts` files for reuse.
  - Creates `voices/` directory in project root if not present
  - Saves trained voice prompts as `voder_tts_character-name_timestamp.tts` files
  - Supports multiple reference audios (video/audio/URL) with SVS voice extraction
  - Optional `test` keyword generates a test sample using a hardcoded 30+ second script after training
  - Optional `test "custom script"` uses a user-provided test script
  - Oneline only: `python voder.py train voice:james "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav" test`

- **Trained Voice Usage in TTS** — The `voice` parameter now accepts trained voice references in addition to voice descriptions.
  - `voice "character-name"` uses the latest `.tts` file with that name from `voices/`
  - `voice "character-name:path/to/file.tts"` uses a specific `.tts` file
  - `voice "character-name:another-name"` uses the latest `.tts` for `another-name`
  - When a trained voice is used, Qwen-TTS Base (voice cloning) is used instead of VoiceDesign
  - Works in both oneline and interactive CLI modes

#### TTS Script Newlines

- **`\n` Newline Support** — TTS scripts now support `\n` for actual newlines in both oneline and interactive CLI modes.
  - Oneline: `tts script "James: First line\nSecond line" voice "James: deep male"`
  - Interactive: Enter `\n` in text to create line breaks within a character's speech

#### Voice Stabilization

- **Automatic VoiceDesign Stabilization** — VoiceDesign characters in dialogue mode are automatically stabilized to prevent vocal drift across long scripts.
  - After a VoiceDesign character produces 3 script lines, the outputs are concatenated, SVS-cleaned, and fed to Qwen-TTS Base for voice extraction
  - All subsequent lines for that character use the cloned voice instead of VoiceDesign
  - This eliminates the gradual voice changes that occur when VoiceDesign regenerates voice characteristics for each line
  - Operates transparently — no user configuration needed

#### STS Universal SVS Pre/Post-Processing

- **SVS Voice Isolation on Source** — All STS modes (VCv1 music, VCv2 speech, VCv2 mimic) now isolate source vocals via SVS before feeding them to the VC model, instead of passing the raw source. This gives the VC model clean voice input and produces significantly cleaner conversions.
  - Source → SVS voice → VC model (only vocals processed)
  - Source → SVS music → saved for recombination after conversion
  - VC output + source music → final output (instrumental untouched by VC)

- **`nomusic` Flag** — Added `nomusic` flag for STS to output converted voice only without mixing back the source music.
  - Useful for extracting raw converted vocals for further processing
  - Mutually exclusive with `music` flag
  - CLI example: `python voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "voice.wav" nomusic`

- **VCv2 SVS Pipeline** — VCv2 (standard STS, mimic) now uses the same SVS voice/music isolation as VCv1 (music STS), making the pre/post-processing universal across all STS modes.

#### TTS Multi-Reference Voice Cloning

- **Multi-Reference Cloning** — TTS voice cloning now supports multiple reference audios per character, concatenated into a single composite for richer voice extraction.
  - Oneline format: `target "(path1.wav)(path2.wav)(path3.wav)"` (single mode) or `target "James:(clip1.wav)(clip2.wav)"` (dialogue mode)
  - Each reference is resolved (video/URL supported), cleaned via SVS voice extraction, then concatenated via ffmpeg
  - The composite reference is fed to Qwen-TTS for a single voice extraction pass
  - Interactive CLI: keeps asking for additional references per character until user hits Enter (first reference required)
  - Backward compatible: single path format still works as before

- **STS Multi-Reference Target** — STS oneline mode now supports multiple voice references via `target "(path1)(path2)(path3)"`, same parenthesized format as TTS. Each reference is resolved, SVS-cleaned, then concatenated into a composite for richer voice conversion. Works for all STS sub-modes (standard, music, mimic).

- **TTM VC Multi-Reference Clone** — TTM VC oneline mode now supports multiple voice references via `clone "(path1)(path2)(path3)"`, same parenthesized format as TTS target. Each reference is resolved, SVS-cleaned, then concatenated into a composite for richer voice cloning.

- **`first` Keyword for Multi-Reference** — Oneline mode supports the `first` keyword before multi-reference paths to extract only the first reference's speaker from all other references via TSE before compiling. Works with: `train voice:name first "ref1" "ref2"`, `target first "(path1)(path2)"` (TTS/STS), `clone first "(path1)(path2)"` (TTM VC). Warns and ignores if only one reference is provided.

#### TTM VC SVS Pipeline

- **SVS Isolation for TTM VC** — TTM VC (both standard and overdose) now isolates TTM output vocals via SVS before feeding them to the VC model, and mixes converted vocals back with TTM instrumental after conversion.
  - TTM output → SVS voice → VC model (only vocals converted)
  - TTM output → SVS music → saved for recombination
  - VC output + TTM music → final output

#### TTM Remix Multi-Source with SVS Isolation

- **Multi-Source Support (Up to 3)** — TTM remix now accepts up to three audio/video sources combined into a single composite for style transfer.
  - Paths are provided directly after `remix` keyword (no separate `source` keyword needed)
  - Each source supports voice/music prefix: `voice "path"` extracts vocals, `music "path"` extracts instrumental, bare path uses audio directly
  - Multiple sources are composed into a 30-second composite before style transfer
  - CLI examples:
    - `python voder.py ttm remix "song1.wav" "song2.wav" "song3.wav" styling "jazz fusion"`
    - `python voder.py ttm remix voice "vocals.wav" music "inst.wav" styling "funk"`

#### Multi-Reference Support (Up to 3)

- **Enhanced Reference System** — TTM sub-tasks now accept up to three reference audio files for style guidance.
  - CLI keyword: `reference` — accepts paths with optional voice/music prefix
  - Format: `reference voice "ref_vocals.wav" music "ref_inst.wav"` or plain `reference "ref.wav"`
  - Voice-prefixed references extract vocals via SVS; music-prefixed extract instrumental
  - Multiple references are composed into a 30-second composite for style guidance
  - Works with: remix, repaint, complete, lego sub-tasks

#### TTM Reference Time Spec

- **Optional Time Spec for References** — TTM reference paths now support an optional time specification prefix to select exact audio segments for reference, instead of using the entire audio.
  - Format: `"nn(path)"` — start at nn seconds, extract up to slot-max seconds (30s/15s/10s depending on ref count)
  - Format: `"nn-nn(path)"` — use specified range, auto-slides to reach slot-max if shorter
  - Format: `"nn-nn/nn-nn/nn-nn(path)"` — multiple ranges from same audio, combined to reach slot-max
  - Works with voice/music prefix: `reference voice "50(ref.wav)"`, `reference music "20-30/40-50(ref.wav)"`
  - Works in repaint multi-pass specs: `"20-80/styling(jazz)/reference-voice(30-60(vocals.wav))"`
  - Slot max: 1 reference = 30s, 2 references = 15s each, 3 references = 10s each
  - Sliding logic: if range is shorter than slot-max, start slides back and/or end slides forward until slot-max reached; if audio is shorter than slot-max, segments loop
  - Fully optional — old format still works, auto-compose behavior unchanged when no time spec is provided

#### TTM Remix Optional Lyrics

- **Lyrics Parameter** — TTM remix now accepts an optional `lyrics` parameter to provide new vocal text.
  - Format: `lyrics "verse words here\nmore on next line"`
  - Applies new lyrics to the remixed section while preserving musical style
  - CLI example: `python voder.py ttm overdose remix "song.wav" lyrics "dreamy verse" styling "synthwave"`

#### SFX Overlay for BGM and Complete Tasks

- **Sound Effect Overlays** — TTM BGM and Complete sub-tasks now support embedding sound effects.
  - CLI keyword: `sfx:` — format: `"sfx:prompt/duration-position/level"`
  - SFX specs must be enclosed in quotes for proper CLI parsing
  - Auto-cuts duration if specified SFX length exceeds remaining source time
  - Position values cannot exceed source duration
  - Examples:
    - `python voder.py ttm bgm "audio.wav" music "piano" "sfx:thunder/10-5/50"`
    - `python voder.py ttm complete "source.wav" add "drums" "sfx:rain/8-22"`

#### TTM Repaint Multi-Pass Mode

- **Sequential Multi-Pass Editing** — TTM repaint now supports multiple passes where each edit builds on the previous output.
  - Each pass specifies: time range, styling, lyrics, references, and bias independently
  - Each pass uses the previous pass's result as its input source
  - Supports up to 3 references per pass with voice/music prefix parsing
  - Format: `start-end/styling(text)/lyrics(text)/reference-voice(path)/reference-music(path)/reference(path)/bias/0-100`
  - CLI example: `python voder.py ttm repaint "song.wav" "20-80/styling(orchestral)" "10-30/styling(jazz)/bias/70"`
  - Example with references: `python voder.py ttm overdose repaint "song.wav" "0-15/styling(lo-fi)" "10-25/styling(dnb)/bias/80/reference-voice(vocals.wav)"`
  - Intermediate files cleaned up automatically after all passes complete

- **Voice/Music Prefix for Repaint Source** — Repaint accepts optional prefix to control SVS processing of the source.
  - `repaint voice "song.wav"` — extracts vocals before repainting
  - `repaint music "song.wav"` — extracts instrumental before repainting
  - `repaint "song.wav"` — uses source directly (existing behavior)

#### SS Mode Overlap-Aware Pipeline

- **Overlap-Aware SS for Overdose** — SS mode with overdose uses VibeVoice ASR with special overlap preservation.
  - Added `transcribe_with_overlaps()` method that instructs VibeVoice to preserve overlapping speaker timestamps
  - Enrollment selection uses overlap-aware scoring: picks segments with least overlap first, then longest duration
  - If best segment has overlap, finds the largest non-overlapped gap within it for clean enrollment
  - Iterative refinement loop re-runs VibeVoice on extracted audio until single speaker confirmed

- **Overlap-Aware SS for Non-Overdose** — Non-overdose SS path uses pyannote with exclusive diarization, skips Whisper.
  - Added `diarize_full()` method to SpeakerDiarization class for exclusive diarization access
  - Uses pyannote's exclusive speaker diarization for clean enrollment without ASR
  - Iterative refinement loop re-runs pyannote on extracted speaker until single speaker confirmed
  - If multiple speakers detected after extraction, cuts to longest exclusive segment as enrollment

- **SS Pipe for TTS Dialogue Voice Extraction** — Interactive TTS dialogue mode now uses `ss_extract_speakers()` pipe (same pattern as `svs_extract_vocals()`) to automatically extract per-speaker audio clips from imported dialogue audio. Speaker numbers from STT transcription map directly to SS outputs, eliminating manual reference entry and improving voice cloning accuracy for both TTS and TTS-overdose modes.

#### TTM Complete Task Enhancements

- **Blend Source Control (usrc)** — Complete task accepts `usrc` keyword to control which source elements blend into generated tracks.
  - CLI format: `ttm complete "source.wav" usrc voice music styling "orchestral"`

- **noblend Flag** — Complete task accepts `noblend` flag to generate tracks without blending with source.
  - Useful for completely new instrument/vocal tracks independent of source
  - CLI format: `ttm complete "source.wav" only "drums" noblend`

- **5Hz LM CoT Pipeline** — Complete task uses 5Hz language model Chain-of-Thought for enhanced generation quality.

- **Styling Prompt** — Complete and lego sub-tasks now accept `styling` parameter for style guidance.

#### TTM BGM Video Support

- **video Flag and Reference for BGM** — BGM subtask supports video input and video URLs as source.
  - Video files are processed: audio extracted, music stripped, new music generated, then remuxed
  - Reference audio for BGM now accepts video files (audio extracted before use)
  - Output format matches input format (video in, video out)

#### TTS SLC Sub-Task (Speaker Language Conversion)

- **`tts slc` Oneline Command** — SLC (Speaker Language Conversion) is now a TTS oneline sub-task instead of a standalone mode. Always translates to English using Whisper large-v3 (not turbo) — no separate `translate` keyword needed.
  - `tts slc "path.wav"` — transcribe, translate to English, resynthesize with original voice
  - `tts slc music "path.wav"` — same as above, but also extracts instrumental via SVS music and blends it with the voice output for music preservation
  - `tts overdose slc "path.wav"` — after TTS output, runs STS v2 non-mimic pass with source vocals for enhanced voice preservation
  - `tts overdose slc music "path.wav"` — overdose + music preservation combined
  - Supports video files, YouTube URLs, and audio files (modernized from standalone SLC which was audio-only)
  - SVS voice isolation on source before transcription for cleaner results
  - Uses Whisper large-v3 exclusively (not turbo) for both transcription and translation — single model load, no redundant second instance
  - `music` flag: SVS music extraction from source + ffmpeg blend with TTS voice output; note voice-music sync may vary
  - `translate` keyword removed — translation to English is now hardcoded (Whisper can only translate to English, not between arbitrary language pairs)

#### TTS SVC Sub-Task (Speaker Voice Conversion)

- **`tts svc` Oneline Command** — SVC (Speaker Voice Conversion) is a new TTS oneline sub-task that transcribes single-speaker audio and re-synthesizes it with a different voice.
  - `tts svc "input_path" target "voice_ref"` — Transcribe single-speaker audio and re-synthesize with a different voice. Pipeline: SVS voice isolation → Whisper transcription (or VibeVoice ASR with `overdose`) → Qwen-TTS synthesis with target voice
  - Supports `overdose` flag: `tts overdose svc "path" target "ref"` uses VibeVoice ASR for transcription
  - Target can be an audio path, trained voice name, or text description (VoiceDesign)
  - Multi-reference targets supported: `target "(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)(ref3.wav)"` concatenates multiple references for richer voice extraction
  - Output naming: `voder_tts_svc_*.wav`, `voder_tts_svc_sts_*.wav`

#### STS Voice Pass (sts: Prefix)

- **`target "sts:voice_ref.wav"`** — Prefix `sts:` on any target reference triggers an additional Seed-VC v2 non-mimic voice conversion pass after the standard Qwen-TTS cloning.
  - Works in single TTS mode: `tts script "text" target "sts:voice.wav"`
  - Works in dialogue mode: `target "Character: sts:voice.wav"` — each line for that character gets the STS pass applied individually before mixing
  - Works in SVC sub-task: `tts svc "input.wav" target "sts:ref.wav"`
  - Works in interactive modify speech: prefix the custom voice reference with `sts:` to apply the pass
  - Multi-reference format supported: `target "sts:(ref1)(ref2)(ref3)"`
  - The STS pass takes the TTS output as the source (speech content to preserve) and the `sts:` reference as the target voice, producing higher voice fidelity
  - Output naming: `voder_tts_sts_*.wav` (single), `voder_tts_svc_sts_*.wav` (SVC), per-line in dialogue (temporary)

#### TTS Interactive Speech Modification (STT+TTS Integration)

- **"Modify Speech?" Prompt** — STT+TTS functionality is now integrated into TTS interactive mode as the first prompt, instead of being a standalone mode.
  - When entering TTS interactive mode, user is asked "Want to modify speech? (Y/N)"
  - If yes: provide audio/video/URL → SVS voice isolation → Whisper transcription → edit text → choose voice (source audio or custom path with optional `sts:` prefix and multi-reference support)
  - After voice selection: "Preserve non-vocals? (Y/N)" — if yes, extracts instrumental via SVS music and blends with voice output
  - If `sts:` prefix used on voice reference: additional Seed-VC v2 non-mimic pass after Qwen-TTS synthesis for enhanced voice fidelity
  - Modernized: supports video files and YouTube URLs (old STT+TTS mode only supported audio)
  - SVS voice isolation before transcription for cleaner results

### Fixed

- **TSE Enrollment Cap (5s) + Peak Normalize** — Fixed enrollment tensor dimensions.
  - TSE enrollment capped at 5 seconds maximum
  - Peak normalization applied to match training configuration
  - Prevents crashes when pad length exceeds source tensor dimensions

- **Circular Pad Crash Fix** — Fixed crash in `tse_extract` when enrollment tensor is 1D.
  - Falls back to repeat enrollment to 5s instead of circular padding
  - Fixes crashes when pad > source tensor dimensions

- **STT Overdose Mode Fixes** — Multiple fixes for overdose path:
  - Skip pyannote and Whisper when in overdose mode (uses VibeVoice only)
  - Fixed compress ratio for overdosed audio processing
  - Fixed dtype issues in the processing pipeline

- **Overdose Per-Segment Timestamps** — Fixed timestamp generation for single-speaker overdose.
  - Strips Lyric/Silence tags from VibeVoice output before processing
  - Produces clean timestamped segments for single speaker confirmation

- **SE Pipeline Reorder** — Speech enhancement now applied post-extraction instead of pre-extraction.
  - Previously: SE applied to combined source before TSE
  - Now: SE applied to each separated speaker file individually after TSE extraction
  - Pipeline files kept in temp until SE completes, then exported to results

- **Case-insensitive character names** — `.tts` voice file naming and lookup now normalize to lowercase, so `JAMes`, `jamES`, and `james` all resolve to the same voice file.

### Changed

- **Interactive CLI Menu Renumbered** — Menu reduced from 10 options to 8 (removed STT+TTS and SLC as standalone modes).

### Removed

- **SLC Mode Removed** — Standalone `slc` mode removed from oneline and interactive CLI. Now available as `tts slc` sub-task with modernized features (video/URL support, SVS isolation, overdose pass).

- **STT+TTS Mode Removed** — Standalone STT+TTS mode removed from interactive CLI menu. Now integrated into TTS interactive mode as "modify speech?" prompt with modernized features (video/URL support, SVS isolation).

- `oneline_sts()` target parameter now supports multi-reference `(path1)(path2)(path3)` format via `_parse_multi_refs()`/`_resolve_multi_refs()`
- `oneline_ttm()` clone parameter now supports multi-reference `(path1)(path2)(path3)` format via `_parse_multi_refs()`/`_resolve_multi_refs()`
- Removed dead function `extract_voice_clips_from_multispeaker()` — replaced by `ss_extract_speakers()` SS pipe (longest-segment cut logic superseded by TSE extraction)
- Standalone SLC mode refactored into `tts slc` oneline sub-task — SLC oneline handler and interactive SLC menu option removed; logic relocated to TTS oneline parser as `slc` sub-task keyword
- Standalone STT+TTS interactive mode refactored into TTS interactive "modify speech?" prompt — STT+TTS menu option removed; speech modification flow now gated behind first prompt in TTS interactive mode
- Interactive CLI menu renumbered from 10 options to 8 (STT+TTS and SLC removed as top-level modes)
- `slc` removed from valid oneline modes list; `stt+tts` removed from interactive mode map
- TTS oneline parser now recognizes `slc` as a sub-task keyword (similar to existing TTM sub-task pattern)
- TTS interactive mode entry point now includes speech modification gate before normal TTS flow
- SVC uses the standard Whisper model (turbo) for transcription by default, VibeVoice ASR when overdose is enabled; the `overdose` flag in SVC only controls which STT engine is used (it does not trigger a Seed-VC v2 pass)
- The `sts:` prefix on target references triggers Seed-VC v2 non-mimic conversion — this is the explicit opt-in mechanism for enhanced voice fidelity, replacing the previous automatic overdose VC pass in SVC and modify speech
- In dialogue mode, STS passes are applied per-line before the final mix, ensuring each character's voice is individually converted
- SVC target parameter now supports multi-reference format `(path1)(path2)(path3)` via `_parse_multi_refs()`/`_resolve_multi_refs()` for richer voice extraction
- Modify speech interactive mode now supports `sts:` prefix and multi-reference format on the voice reference input, replacing the old automatic overdose VC pass
- Fixed STS pass parameter order in `SeedVCV2.convert()` calls — source (speech content) is now correctly passed as the first argument and reference (voice to mimic) as the second in all three locations: SVC STS pass, TTS oneline STS pass, and dialogue STS pass
- Modify Speech interactive output naming now uses `voder_tts_ms_` prefix (was `voder_tts_`), matching the sub-task naming convention used by SLC and SVC

## 04/28/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Enhancement — Dialogue Background Music Reference Support & TTM BGM Subtask**

### Added

#### Dialogue Background Music Reference Support

- **Reference Audio for Dialogue Background Music** — Dialogue background music generation now accepts an optional `reference` parameter that provides stylistic guidance to ACE-Step during music generation.
  - When `reference "path"` is provided alongside the `music` parameter, the reference audio is first processed through the SVS music pipe (BS-RoFormer) to extract clean instrumental music
  - This ensures that only the musical content from the reference is used for style guidance, not any vocals or noise
  - Works in both one-liner CLI and GUI modes
  - CLI syntax: `python src/voder.py tts script "..." voice "..." music "description" reference "path/to/ref.wav"`
  - The reference is passed as a secondary style input to ACE-Step, improving stylistic consistency when the user wants the generated music to match a specific existing track

#### TTM BGM Subtask

- **TTM BGM — Replace Background Music** — A new TTM subtask that takes an existing audio/video source, strips the current music, generates new background music, and mixes it at a configurable volume level.
  - CLI keyword: `bgm` — routes to the new background music replacement pipeline
  - Command format: `ttm [overdose] bgm "source_path" music "description" level 0-100 [reference "path"] [result "path"]`
  - Source can be a local audio file, video file, or a direct URL (YouTube, Bilibili, TikTok)
  - The pipeline first uses SVS voice pipe (BS-RoFormer) to strip existing music from the source, isolating clean speech/vocals
  - Duration is automatically detected from the stripped audio
  - New background music is generated via ACE-Step using the provided music description, split into 250-300s chunks if the duration exceeds the model limit, and concatenated
  - Optional `reference` audio is processed through SVS music pipe to extract clean instrumental before being passed to ACE-Step for style guidance
  - The new music is mixed with the clean vocals at the specified `level` (0-100, default 35)
  - If the source was a video, the final audio is re-muxed back into the video container
  - Output naming: `voder_ttm_bgm_{original-name}_{timestamp}.wav` for audio, `.mp4` for video
  - Normal (non-overdose) uses ACE-Step turbo 1.5 model for standard quality
  - Overdose uses ACE-Step XL 1.5 turbo model for enhanced quality
  - GUI: Added "BGM" as a new sub-mode in the TTM tab with fields for source file, music description, volume level, and optional reference file

### Changed

- **TTS Music Keyword** — `music` keyword added to the one-liner parser's `valid_keywords` list, enabling it alongside other TTS dialogue parameters
- **TTM Sub-Tasks Expanded** — TTM now supports six sub-tasks: `complete`, `lego`, `extract`, `remix`, `repaint`, and the new `bgm`

## 04/18/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Major Update — Three New Modes, Mode Mergers, Speaker Diarization, Vocal Extraction, and TTM Sub-Tasks**

### Added

#### Mode Mergers (Simplification)

- **TTS+VC merged into TTS** — TTS mode now supports voice cloning directly via the `target` parameter. Previously a separate mode, TTS+VC is now integrated into TTS. When a `target` audio file is provided alongside `script` and `voice`, the TTS pipeline applies voice cloning. The old `tts+vc` command is no longer accepted — use `tts` with `target` instead.

- **TTM+VC merged into TTM** — TTM mode now supports voice conversion directly via the `vc` flag and `clone` parameter. Previously a separate mode, TTM+VC is now integrated into TTM. When `vc` is enabled and a `clone` audio is provided, the pipeline chains ACE-Step generation with Seed-VC voice conversion. The old `ttm+vc` command is no longer accepted — use `ttm vc` with `clone` instead.

- **VODER now has 10 processing modes** (down from 9 listed, but TTS+VC and TTM+VC are absorbed into TTS and TTM respectively, while 3 new modes are added: SVS, SLC, SS)

#### New Processing Modes

- **SVS (Song Voice Separate)** — A new standalone mode for vocal/music separation using BS-RoFormer.
  - Uses BS-RoFormer Resurrection model from `pcunwa/BS-Roformer-Resurrection` on HuggingFace
  - Separates vocals from music (voice isolation) and music from vocals (instrumental extraction)
  - Two separation stems: `voice` (extract clean vocals) and `music` (extract instrumental)
  - Supports audio and video input (video audio auto-extracted)
  - Supports YouTube URL input — downloads and separates automatically
  - Model checkpoint directory: `src/models/checkpoints/svs/`
  - Used internally by STS mode for automatic vocal extraction from target reference audio
  - Used internally by TTS mode for vocal extraction from voice cloning targets
  - Used internally by STT mode for pre-cleanup vocal isolation (SVS Stage 1) before transcription

- **SLC (Speaker Language Conversion)** — A new mode that translates speech from one language to another while preserving the speaker's voice identity.
  - Translates audio content from any of Whisper's 99 supported languages to English (or other TTS-supported languages)
  - Preserves the original speaker's vocal characteristics, tone, and delivery style
  - Uses Whisper for transcription/translation and Qwen3-TTS for resynthesis
  - When no target parameter is provided, uses the original input as voice reference — effectively translating speech to English with the same original voice
  - When a target reference is provided, can change speaker voice while translating language
  - For preserving original language (if it's one of the 10 TTS-supported languages), SLC with a different target reference can change the speaker's voice — sometimes matching or surpassing STS mode quality
  - Supports audio files and YouTube URLs as input

- **SS (Speakers Separator)** — A new mode for extracting individual speaker audio from multi-speaker recordings.
  - Uses VibeVoice ASR (microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR) for speaker identification and segmentation
  - Automatically identifies individual speakers and produces separate audio files for each
  - Produces a mapped transcript with speaker labels and timestamps
  - Supports audio and video input
  - Requires 24GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ combined system memory (RAM+Swap/Pagefile)
  - Falls back gracefully to Whisper + pyannote if VibeVoice ASR cannot load

#### New AI Models

  - Two separation stems: `voice` (vocal isolation) and `music` (instrumental extraction)
  - Used by SVS mode for standalone vocal/music separation
  - Used internally by STS for automatic vocal extraction from target reference audio (improves voice conversion quality by removing background music/instruments)
  - Used internally by TTS dialogue mode for vocal extraction from voice cloning targets
  - Used internally by STT mode for pre-cleanup vocal isolation before transcription
  - Source code directory: `src/bs_roformer/` (bundled locally)
  - Model directory: `src/models/checkpoints/svs/`

  - Model config: `acestep-v15-xl-base` with `acestep-5Hz-lm-1.7B` language model
  - Used for TTM sub-tasks: complete, extract, lego (requires 50 inference steps)
  - Requires 32GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ system memory
  - Cannot proceed if resources are insufficient (hard requirement, no fallback)

#### TTM Mode Sub-Tasks

- **TTM Sub-Tasks** — TTM mode now supports five advanced music processing sub-tasks beyond basic generation:
  - `complete` — Completes an existing audio track by generating specified missing instrument/vocal tracks. Uses ACE-Step XL-Base (50 inference steps). Accepts source audio, track classes, optional styling, duration, and reference audio.
  - `lego` — Generates a specific instrument or vocal track based on the context of existing audio. Uses ACE-Step XL-Base. Supports styling and reference audio parameters.
  - `extract` — Extracts a specific instrument or vocal track from mixed audio. Uses ACE-Step XL-Base. Supports specifying track name and duration.
  - `remix` — Applies style transfer to existing audio (music cover). CLI keyword is `remix` (internal method: `cover`). Uses overdose ACE-Step model when `overdose` flag is set, otherwise standard ACE-Step turbo (8 inference steps). Accepts `bias` parameter (0-100, default 40).
  - `repaint` — Repaints a specific time range of existing audio. Uses overdose ACE-Step model when `overdose` flag is set, otherwise standard ACE-Step turbo. Accepts `time:start-end` time range, optional lyrics and `bias` (0-100, default 40).
  - **12 ACE-Step Instrument Tracks**: woodwinds, brass, fx, synth, strings, percussion, keyboard, guitar, bass, drums, backing_vocals, vocals
  - **Track Groups**: `instruments` (10 instrument tracks), `voices` (vocals + backing_vocals), `everything` (all 12 tracks)
  - **Track Resolution System**: `resolve_acestep_tracks()` function handles group expansion, deduplication, and validation
  - **Reference Audio Parsing**: `parse_ref_raw()` function handles `track_name:path` format for per-track reference audio

#### Enhanced STT Mode

- **Translation in STT** — STT mode now supports translation of audio to English using Whisper large-v3.
  - New `translate` option in CLI: "Translate to English? (Y/N)"
  - Uses Whisper large-v3 (not turbo) for the translate task — turbo model does not support translation
  - Downloads and caches `whisper-large-v3.pt` separately from the turbo model
  - Translation works with or without diarization enabled
  - When both translation and diarization are enabled, produces English translated text with speaker labels aligned using overlap matching
  - Output follows the same format as regular transcription but in English

- **Overdose Mode in STT** — STT mode now offers an optional "overdose" quality tier using VibeVoice ASR.
  - Available when translation is NOT enabled (overdose and translate are mutually exclusive)
  - New `overdose` option in CLI: "Enable overdose? (Y/N)"
  - Uses VibeVoice ASR instead of Whisper for transcription
  - Provides native speaker diarization with speaker IDs (no separate pyannote needed)
  - Falls back to Whisper if VibeVoice ASR fails to load (insufficient resources)
  - Requires 24GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ system memory

- **Pre-Cleanup SE in STT (SVS Stage 1)** — STT mode now automatically runs vocal isolation before transcription.
  - Uses BS-RoFormer to extract clean vocals from the input audio
  - Removes background music, instruments, and noise before Whisper processes the audio
  - Applied automatically to all STT operations (transcription, translation, overdose)
  - If SVS isolation fails, proceeds with original audio with a warning
  - Temporary files are cleaned up after processing

#### Enhanced STS Mode

- **Video I/O for STS** — STS mode now supports video input and video output.
  - Video input: Load a video file (MP4, MKV, etc.) as base input — audio is auto-extracted
  - Video output: When base input is a video, output is rendered as MP4 with the converted audio replacing the original audio track
  - Uses FFmpeg for audio-video merging
  - Output naming: video inputs produce `.mp4` output; audio inputs produce `.wav` output
  - Error handling: Falls back to audio-only output if video merge fails

- **Automatic Vocal Extraction for STS** — STS mode now automatically extracts clean vocals from target reference audio.
  - When a target reference is provided, BS-RoFormer is used to extract vocals before voice conversion
  - Removes background music, instruments, and noise from the target
  - If vocal extraction fails, uses original target with a warning
  - Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
  - This improves voice conversion quality significantly for references with background content

#### Enhanced TTS Mode

- **Language Parameter** — TTS mode now exposes a `language` parameter that maps to `SUPPORTED_TTS_LANGUAGES`.
  - Supports 10 languages: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian
  - New `SUPPORTED_TTS_LANGUAGES` constant dictionary with ISO code to full name mapping
  - Default remains "Auto" for auto-detection

- **Auto Vocal Extraction for Voice Cloning** — TTS mode now automatically extracts clean vocals from voice cloning targets.
  - When using `target` parameter for voice cloning, BS-RoFormer extracts vocals from the reference
  - Produces cleaner voice embeddings for more accurate cloning
  - Applied in both single and dialogue modes

- **YouTube URL Support for Voice Prompts** — TTS voice prompts now accept YouTube URLs.
  - Enter a YouTube URL instead of a voice description to clone a voice from that URL
  - Audio is downloaded, vocals are extracted via SVS, then used for voice cloning
  - Cleanup is handled automatically

#### Enhanced Dialogue System

- **YouTube URL Support for Character Voice Assignment** — Dialogue character voice assignments now accept YouTube URLs.
  - In dialogue mode, provide a YouTube URL as a character's voice reference
  - VODER downloads the audio, extracts vocals via SVS, and uses it for voice cloning
  - Multiple characters can each have different YouTube URL references

### Changed

- **10 Processing Modes** — VODER now has 10 distinct processing modes.
  - Modes: STT+TTS, TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SLC, SS
  - TTS+VC is no longer a separate mode — use TTS with `target` parameter for voice cloning
  - TTM+VC is no longer a separate mode — use TTM with `vc` flag for voice conversion
  - The old `tts+vc` and `ttm+vc` commands are no longer accepted and will produce an error

- **ACE-Step Three-Tier System** — ACE-Step now operates in three quality tiers:
  - **Standard**: `acestep-v15-turbo` with `acestep-5Hz-lm-1.7B`, shift=1.0, 8 inference steps
  - **Overdose**: `acestep-v15-xl-turbo` with `acestep-5Hz-lm-4B`, shift=3.0, 8 inference steps
  - **Complete**: `acestep-v15-xl-base` with `acestep-5Hz-lm-1.7B`, shift=1.0, 50 inference steps (for sub-tasks)

- **Enhanced WhisperSTT** — Whisper model now uses dual-model architecture.
  - STT transcription: `large-v3-turbo` (fast, efficient)
  - Translation: `large-v3` (supports translate task, which turbo does not)
  - Custom checkpoint save/load system with `_save_checkpoint()` and `_load_model()` methods
  - Both models cached under `src/models/checkpoints/whisper/`

- **Enhanced SeedVCV1** — Seed-VC v1 now supports automatic vocal extraction.
  - Before voice conversion, BS-RoFormer extracts clean vocals from target reference
  - This removes background music and instruments that could interfere with voice conversion quality
  - Falls back gracefully if SVS extraction fails

- **Enhanced QwenTTS** — Qwen3-TTS now exposes language parameter.
  - `synthesize()` method accepts `language` parameter (default: "Auto")
  - Maps to `SUPPORTED_TTS_LANGUAGES` for validation
  - Allows explicit language control instead of relying solely on auto-detection

- **Centralized Model Storage Updates**:
  - `src/models/checkpoints/svs/` — BS-RoFormer SVS models
  - `src/models/checkpoints/vibevoice_asr/` — VibeVoice ASR model

- **System Resource Detection** — New `get_system_resources()` function for dynamic hardware assessment.
  - Detects single GPU VRAM, total GPU VRAM, system RAM, and swap/pagefile
  - Uses `psutil` where available, falls back to `/proc/meminfo` on Linux
  - Used by VibeVoice ASR, ACE-Step Overdose, and ACE-Step Complete for resource checks
  - Returns `(single_gpu_gb, total_sys_gb)` tuple

- **YouTube URL Expansion** — New `resolve_target_to_audio()` and `download_youtube_video()` functions.
  - `resolve_target_to_audio()`: Resolves any path/URL to a downloadable audio file (supports YouTube URLs, video files, audio files)
  - `download_youtube_video()`: Downloads full video from YouTube URL (used by SVS and TTM modes)
  - Automatic cleanup of temporary downloaded files

- **Updated Dependencies**:
  - New: `rotary_embedding_torch==0.3.5` — Required for BS-RoFormer model
  - New: `beartype==0.14.1` — Required for BS-RoFormer model
  - New: `ml_collections` — Required for BS-RoFormer model
  - Changed: `huggingface-hub>=0.16.0` → `huggingface-hub==0.34.0` (pinned version)

### Technical Notes

- Code size increased from ~7,263 lines (stable voder.py) to ~10,916 lines (bleed voder.py) — approximately 50% increase (+3,653 lines)
- New source directories: `src/asr/` (VibeVoice ASR, 8 files), `src/bs_roformer/` (BS-RoFormer, 10+ files)
- TTS+VC and TTM+VC modes have been fully absorbed into TTS and TTM; the old `tts+vc` and `ttm+vc` commands are no longer accepted
- The 10 modes are: STT+TTS, TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SLC, SS (TTS+VC absorbed into TTS, TTM+VC absorbed into TTM)
- All new models (VibeVoice ASR, BS-RoFormer) support explicit cleanup with `cleanup()` methods

---

## 04/09/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Bug Hunt Activity** — Extensive bug fixes, memory optimizations, and new features

### Added

#### OCR Input Support for TTS Modes

- **OCR Parameter for TTS Mode** — New `ocr` parameter for one-liner TTS commands to extract text from images.
  - Use `ocr "path/to/image.png"` to provide an image file instead of manual text input
  - VODER uses EasyOCR to extract text from the image, then synthesizes the extracted text as speech
  - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, WebP
  - File validation ensures only image formats are accepted
  - Example: `python src/voder.py tts ocr "script_screenshot.png" voice "text: professional male narrator"`
  - Resources are properly cleaned up after OCR extraction (model offload, gc.collect())

- **OCR Parameter for TTS+VC Mode** — New `ocr` parameter for one-liner TTS+VC commands to extract text from images.
  - Same functionality as TTS mode but with voice cloning support
  - Extracted text is synthesized and then cloned to match the target voice reference
  - Example: `python src/voder.py tts ocr "subtitle_image.jpg" target "text: speaker_clone.wav"`
  - Full resource cleanup ensures memory efficiency

- **Mimic Flag for STS Mode** — New `mimic` keyword for one-liner STS commands to enable accent and emotion conversion alongside voice timbre transfer.
  - When `mimic` is present, Seed-VC v2 uses both its AR model (accent/emotion/style) and CFM model (timbre) instead of CFM only
  - This transfers not just the voice sound but also the speaking style, tone patterns, and emotional delivery of the target voice
  - The `mimic` and `music` keywords are mutually exclusive — using both together produces an error
  - Example: `python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target "reference.wav" mimic`

### Fixed

- **Seed-VC v2 Inference Path and Parameters** — Fixed STS voice conversion to use the official recommended inference pipeline and parameters.
  - Switched from `convert_voice()` (legacy non-streaming path) to `convert_voice_with_streaming()` (official v2 inference path)
  - Updated CFG rates from 0.5/0.5 to 0.7/0.7 (intelligibility and similarity) to match official Seed-VC defaults
  - These rates directly control how clearly the content is preserved and how closely the output matches the reference voice
  - The streaming path also handles long audio with proper overlapping chunk processing and reference length limiting

- **STS Mode Music Flag Parsing** — Fixed argument parsing for the `music` flag in STS mode one-liner commands.
  - Music flag detection moved earlier in the parsing logic to prevent conflicts
  - Previously, the `music` keyword could be incorrectly consumed as a script parameter
  - Now correctly handled as a standalone flag alongside other keywords
  - The `music` keyword was also removed from `valid_keywords` list since it should be treated as a flag, not a keyword parameter

- **SeedVCV1 Indentation Fix** — Corrected indentation issue in SeedVCV1 voice conversion processing.
  - The tensor trimming operation `vc_target = vc_target[:, :, mel2.size(-1):]` was incorrectly indented inside a conditional block
  - Fixed to execute unconditionally after voice conversion processing
  - Ensures consistent output length across all voice conversion operations

- **Vocal Language Parameter** — Corrected vocal_language parameter initialization in voice conversion.
  - Initial change from 'en' to 'unknown' was reverted back to 'en'
  - Ensures proper language handling for English vocal content

### Optimized

- **Increased Sequence Length for Voice Conversion** — Extended max_seq_len from 4096 to 8192 in SeedVC models.
  - Updated `max_seq_len` parameter in `BaseModelArgs` class (src/modules/v2/ar.py)
  - Updated `setup_ar_caches()` call in `SeedVCV2` class
  - Allows processing of longer audio segments without sequence length truncation
  - Improves voice conversion quality for extended audio content

- **Memory Cleanup After TTM+VC Processing** — Implemented explicit memory cleanup in TTM+VC voice conversion pipeline.
  - ACE-Step model is now explicitly released after music generation with `del ace_step` and `ace_step = None`
  - Seed-VC model is now explicitly released after voice conversion with `del seed_vc` and `seed_vc = None`
  - Both stages use `gc.collect()` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` for proper memory reclamation
  - Reduces peak memory usage during TTM+VC operations

- **Memory Cleanup After SeedVCV1 Processing** — Implemented explicit memory cleanup after SeedVCV1 voice conversion.
  - All models in SeedVCV1 are now released after processing: whisper_model, whisper_feature_extractor, campplus_model, rmvpe, and main model
  - Uses `del` statements followed by `gc.collect()` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`
  - Prevents memory accumulation during batch voice conversion operations

### Changed

- **Updated VODER Logo** — Redesigned and increased logo display size in README for better visibility.
  - Logo was completely redesigned with a fresh, modern look
  - Logo size increased from 128x128 pixels to 256x256 pixels
  - Provides better visual presence on high-DPI displays

- **SE Mode Output Description** — Clarified SE mode output format in documentation.
  - Updated table to show SE mode supports both audio and video input (was unclear before)

---

## 04/08/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing
- **Major Update — Two New Modes, Script Directives, SFX Integration, and Speech Enhancement**

### Added

#### New Processing Modes

- **SE (Speech Enhancement) Mode** — A new standalone mode for audio quality improvement.
  - Uses UniSE model from [alibaba/unified-audio](https://github.com/alibaba/unified-audio) for professional speech enhancement
  - Denoising — removes background noise, hiss, and artifacts
  - Dereverberation — reduces room echo and reverb effects for cleaner speech
  - Speech restoration — enhances clarity and intelligibility of degraded recordings
  - Supports audio files (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, etc.) and video files (MP4, MKV, AVI, etc.)
  - Video input: audio is automatically extracted for processing
  - Outputs at 16kHz sample rate (optimized for speech content)
  - **Not designed for musical enhancement** — use for speech-only content
  - One-liner CLI: `python voder.py se "noisy_audio.wav" result "/output/enhanced.wav"`
  - Interactive CLI: select option 7 (SE) from the menu
  - Model cached under `src/models/checkpoints/unise/`

- **SFX (Sound Effects Generation) Mode** — A new standalone mode for generating custom sound effects from text.
  - Uses TangoFlux model from [declare-lab/TangoFlux](https://github.com/declare-lab/TangoFlux) for text-to-audio synthesis
  - Generates any sound effect from text descriptions (nature sounds, impacts, ambient, synthesized, etc.)
  - Configurable duration: 1-30 seconds per sound effect
  - Adjustable inference steps: 1-100 (default: 30) — higher values = better quality, slower generation
  - Adjustable guidance scale: 1.0-10.0 (default: 4.5) — controls adherence to the prompt
  - 44.1kHz output quality for professional use
  - One-liner CLI format: `python voder.py sfx sound "thunder rumbling" duration 10 steps 50 guide 3.5`
  - Parameters:
    - `sound` — Text description of the sound effect (required)
    - `duration` — Duration in seconds, 1-30 (required)
    - `steps` — Inference steps for quality control (optional, default 30)
    - `guide` — Guidance scale for prompt adherence (optional, default 4.5)
    - `result` — Output file path (optional)
  - Model cached under `src/models/checkpoints/tangoflux/`

#### Dialogue System Enhancements

- **Script Directives** — Per-line control over timing, volume, and duration within dialogue scripts.
  - `/time:nn` — Position this line at `nn` seconds from the start of the output
  - `/time:nn-nn` — Position at `nn` seconds, cut `-nn` seconds from the end of the clip
  - `/time:nn+nn` — Position at `nn` seconds, cut `+nn` seconds from the start of the clip
  - `/time:nn-nn+nn` — Position at `nn` seconds, cut from both end and start
  - `/level:0-100` — Set volume level for this specific line (default: 100)
  - `/duration:1-30` — Duration for SFX lines (required when using `sfx:` character)
  - Directives are appended at the end of dialogue text, separated by spaces
  - Example: `James: Hello everyone! /time:5 /level:80`
  - Enables precise control over audio production without manual post-processing

- **SFX Character in Dialogue** — Embed sound effects directly in dialogue scripts.
  - Special character `sfx:` (case-insensitive) generates sound effects within dialogue
  - Requires `/duration:nn` directive (1-30 seconds) — mandatory for all SFX lines
  - Optional `/level:0-100` directive to control SFX volume relative to dialogue
  - SFX generation uses TangoFlux model (same as standalone SFX mode)
  - SFX clips are positioned in the timeline using `/time:` directive if specified
  - Example dialogue:
    ```
    James: Welcome to our show!
    sfx: audience applause /duration:5 /level:60
    Sarah: Thanks for having us!
    sfx: gentle ambient music /duration:15 /level:30 /time:0
    James: Let's get started with today's topic.
    ```
  - Available in both TTS and TTS+VC dialogue modes
  - Works in GUI, interactive CLI, and one-liner CLI

- **Enhanced Dialogue Assembly** — Complete rewrite of the dialogue generation pipeline.
  - New `_assemble_enhanced_dialogue()` function handles all dialogue assembly
  - Per-clip audio effects using FFmpeg (time positioning, volume control)
  - SFX generation integrated into the dialogue pipeline
  - Support for overlapping audio via time positioning
  - Automatic calculation of total duration based on positioned clips
  - Efficient temp file management with automatic cleanup

- **Cross-use Feature** — Mix generated and cloned voices in the same dialogue.
  - Both TTS and TTS+VC one-line modes now support combining `voice` and `target` parameters
  - Use `voice "Character: prompt"` for generated voices (Voice Design)
  - Use `target "Character: path"` for cloned voices (Voice Cloning)
  - Example: `python voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: male" target "Sarah: /path/to/sarah.wav"`
  - Enables hybrid dialogues where some characters use generated voices and others use cloned references
  - A character cannot have both `voice` and `target` — each character must use one or the other

- **Music Volume Level Control** — Fine-grained control over background music volume.
  - New `level` parameter for one-liner dialogue commands
  - Supports constant volume, time-based segments, and fade transitions
  - Format options:
    - `"volume"` — Constant volume percentage (e.g., `"35"` for 35%)
    - `"start:vol-end:vol"` — Different volumes at start and end times
    - `"start:from-to+fade"` — Fade from one volume to another over specified duration
  - Default remains 35% if `level` parameter is not specified
  - Example: `python voder.py tts script "James: Hello" voice "James: male" music "piano" level "0:30-60:50"`
  - Time-based segments allow dynamic music volume throughout the dialogue
  - FFmpeg volume filter with evaluate-per-frame for smooth transitions

#### TTM Mode Enhancement

- **Instrumental Music Generation** — TTM mode now produces music-only (no vocals) output.
  - Use empty lyrics `"..."` to generate instrumental music without any vocal content
  - The model produces music matching the style prompt without singing
  - Ideal for background music, ambient tracks, and instrumental compositions
  - Example: `python voder.py ttm lyrics "..." styling "cinematic orchestral" duration 60`
  - Works with TTM+VC mode as well — voice conversion will have no effect on instrumental output
  - Lyrics in `()` or `[]` brackets provide context without being sung (for music-with-vocals generation)

#### Auto-Clone Feature Enhancement

- **TTS+VC Dialogue + Auto-Clone Trick** — Useful behavior when using the same file for both dialogue source and auto-clone.
  - Dialogue source analysis generates character names as `1`, `2`, `3`... based on speaker detection order
  - Auto-clone voice extraction produces voice references labeled `speaker 1`, `speaker 2`, etc.
  - The system matches character names to voice references **alphabetically**
  - **Result:** Using the same input file for both dialogue source and auto-clone produces an exact replica of the original audio
  - This is useful for:
    - Testing the TTS+VC pipeline accuracy
    - Verifying speaker detection quality
    - Creating backup/restoration of audio content
    - Demonstrating the voice cloning system's capabilities

### Changed

- **Expanded Processing Modes** — VODER now has 9 processing modes (up from 7).
  - Modes: STT+TTS, TTS, TTS+VC, STS, TTM, TTM+VC, STT, SE, SFX
  - GUI dropdown updated with new mode options
  - Interactive CLI menu updated with options 7 (SE) and 8 (SFX)

- **Centralized Model Storage** — New model directories added for UniSE and TangoFlux.
  - `src/models/checkpoints/unise/` — UniSE speech enhancement model
  - `src/models/checkpoints/tangoflux/` — TangoFlux sound effects model
  - Directories auto-created at startup

- **Updated Dependencies**:
  - `transformers==4.57.3` (pinned version, was `>=4.30.0`)
  - New: `einx`, `x-transformers==2.3.1`, `safetensors`, `soxr`, `tqdm`, `packaging` — required for UniSE model
  - These enable speech enhancement model loading and inference

### Technical Notes

- Code size increased from ~6650 lines (voder.py bleed v1) to ~7100+ lines — approximately 7% increase

### Added
- **Background Music Chunking for Long Dialogues** — Enhanced background music generation to handle dialogues longer than 250 seconds by generating multiple music chunks and concatenating them.
  - When background music is enabled and required duration exceeds 250 seconds, the system now generates multiple consecutive music chunks (250s each) using the same music description
  - All chunks are concatenated into a single music file using FFmpeg concat demuxer before mixing with dialogue
  - This ensures uninterrupted background music throughout the entire dialogue instead of silence after the first chunk
  - Maximum chunk size set to 250 seconds for optimal performance and compatibility with ACE-Step model limits

### Fixed
- **Music Generation Minimum Duration** — Fixed VODER's minimum music duration to match ACE-Step model requirements.
  - ACE-Step model requires a minimum of 10 seconds for generation, but VODER previously allowed inputs as low as 5 seconds
  - VODER now enforces 10-second minimum for music generation to prevent generation failures
  - This applies to both GUI and CLI modes

## 04/02/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing

### Added
- **STT (Speech-to-Text) Standalone Mode** — A new dedicated `stt` mode available via one-liner CLI.
  - Transcribe audio, video, image, or YouTube URL to text using Whisper
  - Supports `timestamp` flag to include word-level timestamps in format `[mm:ss:mss-mm:ss:mss]`
  - Supports `dialogue` flag to enable speaker diarization (pyannote) with numbered speaker labels
  - Batch processing: multiple files processed sequentially in a single command
  - Supports audio files, video files (auto-extracts audio), image files (OCR via EasyOCR), and YouTube/Bilibili/TikTok URLs
  - Output saved as `.txt` files with descriptive naming (e.g., `voder_stt_timestamp_dialogue_...`, `voder_stt_ocr_...`, `voder_youtube_...`)
  - One-liner examples:
    ```
    python voder.py stt "audio.wav"
    python voder.py stt "audio.wav" timestamp
    python voder.py stt "audio.wav" dialogue
    python voder.py stt "audio.wav" timestamp dialogue
    python voder.py stt "audio1.wav" "audio2.wav"
    python voder.py stt "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
    ```

- **Speaker Diarization (Pyannote Integration)** — New `SpeakerDiarization` class for identifying and separating speakers in audio.
  - Uses `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1` model (requires HuggingFace token with accepted model conditions)
  - Word-level alignment between Whisper transcription timestamps and pyannote speaker turns
  - Three-tier speaker assignment: fully-contained words get priority, then best overlap, then nearest neighbor
  - Post-processing: assigns words without speakers to nearest speaker; merges very short utterances (<0.5s) with neighbors
  - Available in STT mode (`dialogue` flag), dialogue source analysis, and voice clip extraction
  - Local pyannote integration bundled in `src/libs/pyannote/` to avoid huggingface_hub version conflicts
  - Requires HF_TOKEN.txt with access to `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1`

- **Image Text Extraction (EasyOCR)** — New `EasyOCRReader` class for extracting text from images.
  - Supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.tiff`, `.webp`
  - CPU-based OCR (no GPU required)
  - Can be used as input source for STT mode and dialogue source analysis
  - Images always produce single-speaker output (no diarization possible)
  - Model cached under centralized `src/models/checkpoints/easyocr/`

- **YouTube & Video Platform Download (yt-dlp)** — New download integration for audio extraction from URLs.
  - Supports YouTube, YouTube Shorts, youtu.be, Bilibili, and TikTok URLs
  - Downloads best available audio via yt-dlp, converts to MP3 (192kbps)
  - Robust error handling for invalid URLs, unavailable videos, network errors
  - Falls back to `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.webm` if `.mp3` not created
  - Temporary files cleaned up after processing
  - Works as input for STT mode, dialogue source analysis, and voice clip extraction

- **Dialogue Source from Files & URLs** — Comprehensive multi-format dialogue source support.
  - New `validate_dialogue_source_file()` accepts: text files, audio/video files, image files, YouTube URLs
  - New `analyze_dialogue_source()` full analysis pipeline:
    - Text files: parsed with auto-formatting (auto-detects dialogue vs single mode, normalizes format)
    - Audio/Video files: Whisper transcription + optional pyannote diarization
    - Image files: EasyOCR text extraction (single speaker)
    - YouTube URLs: download + Whisper transcription + optional diarization
  - Speaker label mapping: original pyannote labels → numbered speakers (1, 2, 3...)
  - Smart speaker switching: only switches on significant gaps (0.3s) or after 3+ words to avoid rapid switching artifacts
  - Available in interactive CLI for both TTS and TTS+VC modes

- **Automatic Voice Clip Extraction from Multi-Speaker Audio** — *(Replaced by SS pipe — see 05/21/2026 `ss_extract_speakers()`)* ~~Extract individual speaker voice clips automatically.~~
  - ~~New `extract_voice_clips_from_multispeaker()` function~~ — Removed (dead code)
  - ~~Given a multi-speaker audio source (file or YouTube URL), extracts the longest voice clip per speaker~~
  - ~~Uses Whisper (word timestamps) + Pyannote (speaker diarization) for speaker identification~~
  - ~~Extracts clips via FFmpeg with precise timing~~
  - ~~Integrated with TTS+VC interactive CLI: after entering dialogue, user can provide a multi-speaker source and clips are auto-assigned to characters alphabetically~~
  - ~~Falls back to manual entry if not enough clips extracted~~

- **`result` Parameter** — New universal CLI parameter to copy the latest result to a specified path.
  - Works with all one-liner modes
  - Example: `python voder.py tts script "Hello" voice "male" result "/path/to/output.txt"`
  - Creates directories as needed, preserves file metadata

### Changed
- **Centralized Model Management System** — Complete overhaul of model storage and caching.
  - All models now stored under `src/models/` with organized directory structure:
    - `models/tmp/` — temporary downloads in progress
    - `models/checkpoints/qwen_tts_voicedesign/` — Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign
    - `models/checkpoints/qwen_tts_base/` — Qwen3-TTS Base
    - `models/checkpoints/acestep/` — ACE-Step models
    - `models/checkpoints/seed_vc_v1/` — Seed-VC v1
    - `models/checkpoints/seed_vc_v2/` — Seed-VC v2
    - `models/checkpoints/whisper/` — Whisper model
  - HuggingFace environment variables redirected to local directories (HF_HOME, HF_HUB_CACHE, TRANSFORMERS_CACHE, HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE)
  - Whisper cache (XDG_CACHE_HOME) redirected for openai-whisper downloads
  - All directories auto-created at startup
  - All model classes (WhisperSTT, QwenTTSVoiceDesign, QwenTTS, SeedVCV2, SeedVCV1) use centralized paths

- **Enhanced HF_TOKEN Handling** — Improved token discovery and error messaging.
  - Multi-location fallback search: CWD, src directory, `1/` directory
  - Auto-creates template `HF_TOKEN.txt` with instructions if file doesn't exist
  - More informative warning messages with links to HuggingFace token settings and pyannote model conditions
  - Token set as `os.environ["HF_TOKEN"]` for all HuggingFace operations

- **Updated Dependencies**:
  - `torch==2.8.0`, `torchaudio==2.8.0`, `torchvision==0.23.0` (was >=2.0.0)
  - New: `torch-audiomentations>=0.12.0`, `hydra-core==1.3.2`, `opentelemetry-proto==1.0.0`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc==1.0.0`, `sox`, `onnxruntime`, `lightning==2.4`, `yt-dlp>=2026.3.17`, `easyocr>=1.7.0`
  - `qwen-tts` removed from pip requirements — now bundled locally in `src/qwen_tts/`
  - Pyannote bundled locally in `src/libs/pyannote/` (requirements2.txt includes `pyannote.database`, `pyannote.metrics`, `pyannote.pipeline`, `asteroid-filterbanks`)

### Technical Notes
- Code size increased from ~4880 lines (voder.py stable) to ~6650 lines (voder.py bleed) — a 36% increase
- voder2.py is a slightly stripped version of voder.py (same functionality, fewer comments/docstrings)
- All new models (EasyOCR, Pyannote) are immediately offloaded after use to prevent memory accumulation
- The `load_custom_model_from_hf()` function now accepts optional `target_dir` parameter for flexible download locations

## 02/24/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, still developing, there will be a major update!

### Added
- **MSTS (Music-STS) in STS mode** – STS now supports musical inputs via the Seed-VC v1 model (44.1kHz) for better music voice conversion quality.
  - **GUI**: When pressing Generate in STS mode, a dialog appears asking "musical inputs?" with Yes/No buttons. Yes uses v1 model at 44.1kHz; No uses standard v2 at 22.05kHz.
  - **Interactive CLI**: After entering base and target paths, user is prompted "Are the inputs musical? (Y/N):". Y uses v1 model; N uses standard v2.
  - **One-line CLI**: New `music` keyword parameter: `voder.py sts path/base path/target music`. Invalid parameters show error message.
  - **Output naming**: MSTS outputs prefixed with `voder_m_sts_timestamp.wav`; standard STS uses `voder_sts_timestamp.wav`.

### Fixed
- **TTS+VC dialogue voice cloning stability** – Voice characteristics are now extracted once per character instead of re-extracting for each line.
  - In dialogue with multiple lines per character (e.g., 5 lines for "James"), the voice prompt is extracted once and reused for all lines of that character.
  - This ensures consistent voice quality throughout the dialogue, eliminating variations that occurred when re-extracting voice for each line.
  - Applies to GUI, interactive CLI, and one-line CLI modes.

### Optimized
- **Memory offloading after processing** – Models are now explicitly unloaded from memory/VRAM after each operation completes.
  - In GUI mode: ProcessingThread now calls cleanup() after finishing, releasing all loaded models.
  - In interactive CLI mode: Each mode (TTS, TTS+VC, STS, STT+TTS, TTM, TTM+VC) now offloads models before returning.
  - This prevents memory accumulation when performing multiple operations in a single session.
  - Pattern applied: `del model`, `gc.collect()`, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.

## 02/12/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, under aggressive testing, still developing

### Added
- **Full dialogue support in CLI** – Both interactive and one‑liner modes now support multi‑speaker scripts.
  - Interactive CLI: enter multiple lines with `Character: text` format; VODER automatically prompts for voice prompts (TTS) or audio file paths (TTS+VC) per character.
  - One‑liner: repeated `script` and `voice`/`target` parameters allow dialogue generation in a single command.
- **Optional background music for dialogue scripts** – Available in TTS and TTS+VC modes when the script contains at least one `Character: text` line.
  - **GUI**: Clean modal dialog appears before generation, asking for a music description. OK with non‑empty description triggers music; Skip bypasses.
  - **Interactive CLI**: After voice prompts/assignments, user is asked `Add background music? (y/N):`. Enter `y`/`yes` to provide a description; empty input skips.
  - **One‑liner CLI**: New `music "description"` parameter. If present with non‑empty value, background music is generated; `music ""` is ignored. Parameter is ignored in single mode (no colon in scripts).
  - **Automatic duration fitting**: Music length matches the exact duration of the concatenated dialogue (via `torchaudio.info`).
  - **Volume control**: Music is mixed at 35% relative volume using FFmpeg (`volume=0.35`), empirically chosen for non‑intrusive ambience.
  - **Memory management**: ACE‑Step model is explicitly released and GPU cache cleared after music generation, minimising VRAM footprint.
  - **Cleanup**: Temporary dialogue and music files are deleted; only the final mixed file remains in `results/` with an `_m` suffix (e.g., `voder_tts_dialogue_..._m.wav`).

### Updated
- **Row‑based dialogue editor in GUI** – Replaced free‑text script box with per‑row Character/Dialogue fields.
  - New rows auto-add when the last row is filled; first row has no delete button, subsequent rows can be deleted.
  - Voice prompt area dynamically shows each character with a text field (TTS) or audio‑number dropdown (TTS+VC).
  - Audio reference files are numbered; dropdowns update automatically when files are added/removed.

### Fixed
- **Memory optimisation for TTM+VC** – ACE‑Step model is now explicitly released and GPU cache cleared before loading Seed‑VC. Reduces peak VRAM usage and improves reliability on 8GB cards.

## 02/10/2026
- Status: Stable, all features work, under aggressive testing, still developing

### Fixed
- Seed-VC v2 unmatched tensor error which caused both STS and TTM+VC to fail. Now STS works perfectly; TTM+VC will receive further optimisations.
